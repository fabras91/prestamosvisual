1. OVERVIEW.

   a. Software. The software is a suite of Microsoft development tools, software programs, and documentation.  

   b. License model.  The software is licensed based on:

      * the number of users that use the software.  

2. INSTALLATION AND USE RIGHTS.  If you comply with this agreement, for each license you acquire, you have the rights below. 

   a. General.  One user may install and use copies of the software to design, develop, test and demonstrate your programs.  Testing does not include staging on a server in a production environment, such as loading content prior to production use.

   b. Other Terms Covering Software.  

      * Third Party Programs.  If other terms come with a program licensed by a third party, those terms apply to your use of it.

      * Included Microsoft Programs.  These terms apply to all Microsoft programs included with the software.  If the terms that come with an included Microsoft program give you more rights that do not conflict with express limitations in this agreement, then you also have those rights.

      * Pre-Release Code.  If other terms come with pre-release code, those terms apply to your use of it.

3. ADDITIONAL LICENSING REQUIREMENTS AND/OR USE RIGHTS.  

   a. Documentation. Any person that has access to your internal network may copy and use the documentation for your internal purposes.

   b. Testing. Any person may access the software to test your programs as long as they only use the executable files of your programs.

   c. Distributable Code. 

      1. Right to Use and Distribute.  Distributable Code is code and related text files that are listed in a REDIST.TXT file or marked as "sample" code.  If you comply with this agreement, you may:

         * REDIST.TXT Files.  Copy and distribute the object code form of Distributable Code listed in REDIST.TXT files. The software may also contain the following Distributable Code. If so, you may also:

         * copy and distribute the unmodified output of merge modules (Microsoft Merge Modules); and

         * modify the source code form of Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC), Active Template Libraries (ATL), and C runtimes (CRTs) to design, develop and test your programs, and copy and distribute the object code form of your modified files under a new name.

         * Sample Code.  Modify, copy and distribute the source and object code form of "sample" code.

         * Third Party Distribution.  Permit distributors of your programs to copy and distribute the Distributable Code as part of those programs.    

      2. Distribution Requirements.  For any Distributable Code you distribute, you must:

         * add significant new functionality to it in your programs;

         * require distributors, and external end users, to agree to terms that protect it at least as much as this agreement; 

         * display your valid copyright notice on your programs; and

         * indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Microsoft from any claims, including attorneys' fees, related to the distribution or use of your programs.

      3. Distribution Restrictions.  You may not:

         * alter any copyright, trademark or patent notices in the Distributable Code; 

         * use Microsoft's name, logo or trademarks to market your programs; 

         * distribute any Distributable Code that runs on any platform other than the Windows platform; or 

         * modify or distribute the source code of any Distributable Code so that any part of it becomes subject to an Excluded License.  An Excluded License is one that requires, as a condition of use, modification or distribution, that:

         * the code be disclosed or distributed in source code form, or

         * others have the right to modify it.

4. SCOPE OF LICENSE.  The software is licensed, not sold.  This agreement only gives you some rights to use the software.  Microsoft reserves all other rights.  Unless applicable law gives you more rights despite this limitation, you may use the software only as expressly permitted in this agreement.  The software is engineered to allow you to use it in certain ways.  You must comply with these technical limitations.  For more information about them, see the software documentation.  You may not:

   * work around technical limitations in the software,

   * reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble the software, except and only to the extent that applicable law expressly permits, despite this limitation,

   * make more copies of the software than specified in this agreement or allowed by applicable law, despite this limitation,

   * publish the software for others to copy,

   * rent, lease or lend it, or

   * use it for commercial software hosting services.

5. DOWNGRADE.  You may install and use an earlier version of the software at the same time.  If you install an earlier version, this agreement applies.  The earlier version may contain software components which are not included in this version of the software.  If so, the terms specific to those components will apply to your use of them.  The agreement that accompanies the earlier version of the software contains those terms.  Microsoft is not obligated to supply earlier versions to you.

6. TRANSFER TO A THIRD PARTY.  The first user of the software may transfer it and this agreement directly to a third party.  Before the transfer, that party must agree that this agreement applies to the transfer and use of the software.  The first user must uninstall the software before transferring it separately from the device.  The first user may not retain any copies.

7. REASSIGNMENT OF LICENSES.  You may permanently reassign a license from one user to another.

8. SPECIAL LABEL SOFTWARE.

   a. Academic Edition Software.  If the software is marked "Academic Edition" or "AE," you may use it only if you are a "Qualified Educational User."  If you do not know whether you are a Qualified Educational User, visit www.microsoft.com/education or contact the Microsoft affiliate serving your country.

9. BACKUP COPY.  You may make one backup copy of the software.  You may use it only to reinstall the software.

10. EXPORT RESTRICTIONS.  The software is subject to U.S. export laws and regulations.  You must comply with all domestic and international export laws and regulations that apply to the software.

11. SUPPORT SERVICES.  Microsoft provides support services for the software as described at www.support.microsoft.com/common/international.aspx.

12. ENTIRE AGREEMENT.  This agreement (including the warranty below) and any amendments to it, and the terms for supplements, updates, Internet-based services and support services, are the entire agreement for the software and support services.

13. APPLICABLE LAW.  

   a. United States.  If you acquired the software in the United States, Washington state law governs the interpretation of this agreement and applies to claims for breach of it, regardless of conflict of laws principles.  The laws of the state where you live govern all other claims, including claims under state consumer protection laws, unfair competition laws, and in tort.

   b. Outside the United States.  If you acquired the software in any other country, the laws of the country where you live apply. 

14. LEGAL EFFECT.  This agreement describes certain legal rights.  You may have other rights under the laws of your state or country.  You may also have rights with respect to the party from whom you acquired the software.  This agreement does not change your rights under the laws of your state or country if the laws of your state or country do not permit it to do so.  

15. LIMITATIONS ON AND EXCLUSIONS OF DAMAGES.  YOU CAN RECOVER FROM MICROSOFT AND ITS SUPPLIERS ONLY DIRECT DAMAGES UP TO THE AMOUNT YOU ACTUALLY PAID FOR THE SOFTWARE. YOU CANNOT RECOVER ANY OTHER DAMAGES, INCLUDING CONSEQUENTIAL, LOST PROFITS, SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES.

This limitation applies to

   * any matter related to the software, services, content (including code) on third party Internet sites, or third party programs, and

   * claims for breach of contract, breach of warranty, guarantee or condition, strict liability, negligence, or other tort to the extent permitted by applicable law.

It also applies even if

   * repair, replacement or a refund for the software does not fully compensate you for any losses, or

   * Microsoft knew or should have known about the possibility of the damages.

Some states do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you.  They also may not apply to you because your country may not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental, consequential or other damages.
