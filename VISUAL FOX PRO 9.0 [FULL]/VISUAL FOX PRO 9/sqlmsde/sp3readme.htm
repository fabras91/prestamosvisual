<H1><A NAME="_introduction"></A>1.0 Introduction</H1>

<P>Microsoft SQL Server 2000 Service Pack 3a (SP3a) incorporates changes to SQL Server 2000 SP3 that address issues raised by the Slammer worm:

<UL type=disc>
	<LI>SP3a can be applied to SQL Server 2000 Enterprise Evaluation Edition in order to apply fixes to instances of that edition of SQL Server.<BR><BR></LI>

	<LI>SP3a addresses setup issues some customers encountered with the version of the Microsoft Data Access (MDAC) components in SQL Server 2000 SP3.<BR><BR></LI>

	<LI>The MSDE 2000 SP3a Setup utility now defaults to turning off support for network connections when installing new instances of MSDE 2000. The current network support settings are retained when instances are upgraded to SP3a.<BR><BR></LI>

	<LI>When an instance of SQL Server 2000 SP3a or MSDE 2000 SP3a is configured to not support network connections, the instance also stops using UDP port 1434.</LI>
</UL>

<P>Because most changes introduced in SP3a are related to Setup, you do not need to apply SP3a to instances of SQL Server 2000 or MSDE 2000 that have already been upgraded to SP3. If you have instances that have not yet been upgraded to SP3, however, you should always upgrade those instances directly to SP3a instead of SP3. If you have any copies of the SP3 download files that you were planning to use for future upgrades, you should delete those copies and instead use either the SP3a download files or the SP3a CD-ROM. Applications that distribute and install MSDE 2000 should install SP3a instead of SP3. While you can apply SP3a to instances of SQL Server 2000 SP3 or MSDE 2000 SP3, doing so has little effect on those instances.</P>

<P>This release of Service Pack 3a (SP3a) for Microsoft&reg; SQL Server&trade; 2000 is provided in three parts:

<UL type=disc>
	<LI>Database Components SP3a provides updates for the database components of an instance of SQL Server 2000, excluding instances of the SQL Server 2000 Desktop Engine. Database Components SP3a includes updates to:
<UL type=disc>
	<LI>The database engine.<BR><BR></LI>

	<LI>All of the database client tools and utilities such as SQL Server Enterprise Manager and the <B>osql</B> utility.<BR><BR></LI>

	<LI>Database client connectivity components, such as the Microsoft OLE DB Provider for SQL Server 2000, the SQL Server 2000 ODBC driver, and the client Net-Libraries.</LI>
</UL>

<P class=indent><!--NOTE--><P ID="Alert_Note"><B>Note</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;If separate instances of both MSDE 2000 and other editions of the SQL Server 2000 database engine are installed on the same computer, you must apply Desktop Engine SP3a to instances of MSDE 2000, and Database Components SP3a to instances of the SQL Server 2000 database engine, such as Personal Edition, Standard Edition, or Enterprise Edition.</P>
</P><!--/NOTE-->
<P class=indent><!--NOTE--><P ID="Alert_Note"><B>Note</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Desktop Engine SP3a is the only part of the service pack that is available in Portuguese (Brazil), Swedish, and Dutch, because SQL Server 2000 Desktop Engine (MSDE 2000) is the only version of SQL Server 2000 that is produced for those languages. The SQL Server 2000 components upgraded by Database Components SP3a or Analysis Services SP3a are not available in those languages. Portuguese (Brazil), Swedish, and Dutch users who want to apply SP3a to a version of SQL Server other than Desktop Engine must download the SP3a files that match the language of the edition they want to upgrade. For example, English-language SP3a files must be downloaded to upgrade the English-language version of the SQL Server 2000 database engine. For information about how to download the service pack, see Section 2.0 <A HREF="#_downloading_and_extracting_sp3">Downloading and Extracting SP3a</A>.</P>
</P><!--/NOTE-->
<H2><A NAME="_details_of_database_components_sp3_installation"></A>1.1 Overview of Database Components SP3a Installation</H2>

<P>The Database Components SP3a Setup program automatically detects which edition of SQL Server 2000 is present on the instance of SQL Server 2000 being upgraded. Setup upgrades only the components that are installed for that instance. For example, if you apply the service pack to a computer running SQL Server 2000 Standard Edition, the service pack does not attempt to upgrade components that are included only with SQL Server 2000 Enterprise Edition.</P>

<P>You can apply Database Components SP3a to a single default instance or a named instance of SQL Server. If you are upgrading multiple instances of SQL Server 2000 to SP3a, you must apply SP3a to each instance. When one instance on a computer with one or more instances of SQL Server 2000 is upgraded to SP3a, all of the tools are upgraded to SP3a. There are not separate copies of the tools for each instance. </P>

<H2><A NAME="_1462_overview_of_desktop_engine_40msde_2_wluf"></A>1.2 Overview of Desktop Engine (MSDE 2000) SP3a Installation</H2>

<P>Desktop Engine SP3a can be used to:

<UL type=disc>
	<LI>Upgrade an existing instance of SQL Server 2000 Desktop Engine (MSDE 2000) to SP3a.<BR><BR></LI>

	<LI>Install a new instance of MSDE 2000 SP3a, provided you have an MSDE 2000 license that allows you to install instances of MSDE 2000.<BR><BR></LI>

	<LI>Upgrade an instance of MSDE 1.0 to MSDE 2000, provided you have an MSDE 2000 license that allows you to run instances of MSDE 2000.<BR><BR></LI>

	<LI>Provide the files needed for a developer to write an application setup utility that can install an instance of MSDE 2000 SP3a as part of the installation of the application. The developer must have a license to distribute MSDE with applications.</LI>
</UL>

<P>For more information about MSDE 2000 licensing, see <A HREF="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=10253" target=_blank>Uses of MSDE 2000</A>.</P>

<P>The procedures for applying SQL Server 2000 Service Pack 3a to an existing instance of MSDE 2000 depend on how the instance was installed. The Desktop Engine SP3a files from Microsoft can only be used to apply SP3a to instances of MSDE 2000 that were installed using the MSDE 2000 setup utility. Most applications install MSDE 2000 using one of two mechanisms:

<UL type=disc>
	<LI>The setup utility of the application calls the MSDE 2000 setup utility during installation. Instances of MSDE 2000 installed this way can be upgraded to SP3a using the Desktop Engine SP3a files.<BR><BR></LI>

	<LI>If the setup utility of the application uses Microsoft Windows Installer technology, the setup utility can directly consume the MSDE 2000 merge modules. Instances of MSDE 2000 installed this way cannot be upgraded using the Desktop Engine SP3a files. You must contact the application vendor for a patch file. Desktop Engine (MSDE 2000) SP3a provides merge modules to support existing applications that use merge modules. The Setup utilities for new applications should be written to call the MSDE 2000 Setup utility instead of directly consuming the MSDE 2000 merge modules.</LI>
</UL>

<P>Instructions for determining whether an instance of MSDE 2000 can be upgraded to SP3a using Desktop Engine SP3a are in section 2.1 <A HREF="#_2461_downloading_and_extracting_desktop__fzpy">Downloading and Extracting Desktop Engine (MSDE 2000) SP3a</A>. Even if you are applying Desktop Engine SP3a from the SQL Server 2000 SP3a CD, read the instructions in section 2.1 to determine whether you can apply Desktop Engine SP3a or you must contact an application vendor for a patch file.</P>

<P>If there are multiple instances of MSDE 2000 on a computer, you must evaluate each instance individually to determine whether you can apply Desktop Engine SP3a. You must also apply SP3a separately to each instance.</P>

<P>Review the material in sections 1 and 2 of this readme, and then follow the instructions in section 3 if:

<UL type=disc>
	<LI>You have determined that you can apply Desktop Engine SP3a to your existing instance of MSDE.<BR><BR></LI>

	<LI>You are installing a new instance of MSDE 2000.<BR><BR></LI>

	<LI>You are incorporating the Desktop Engine SP3a files into the setup utility of an application.</LI>
</UL>

<P>These sections give examples for the most common scenarios of either upgrading an existing instance of MSDE to SP3a, or installing a new instance of MSDE 2000 SP3a:

<H2><A NAME="_removing_sp3"></A>1.3 Removing SP3a</H2>

<P>The way in which you remove SQL Server 2000 SP3a depends on the SQL Server 2000 SP3a components that you are removing.</P>

<H5>Removing SQL Server Database Components and Desktop Engine SP3a</H5>

<P>When either SQL Server Database Components SP3a or Desktop Engine SP3a are installed, they make changes to the system tables for maintenance reasons, and they also upgrade user and distribution databases that are members of a replication topology. Because of these changes, SP3a cannot be removed easily. To revert to the build that you were running before installing SP3a, first, you must uninstall the instance of the SQL Server 2000 database engine or MSDE 2000; then, you must reinstall that instance. If you were running a previous SQL Server 2000 service pack or applied any Quick Fix Engineering (QFE) fixes, you must reapply that service pack and any QFE fixes to the instance. </P>

<P class=indent><!--NOTE--><P ID="Alert_Note"><B>Note</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;To remove SP3a, you must have backups of the <B>master</B>, <B>model</B>, and <B>msdb</B> databases, which were taken immediately prior to applying SP3a. For more information, see Section 3.1 <A HREF="#_back_up_your_sql_server_databases">Back Up Your SQL Server Databases</A> and Section 3.2 <A HREF="#_back_up_your_analysis_services_databases">Back Up Your Analysis Services Databases and Repository</A>. </P><!--/NOTE--></P>

<P>For more information, see <A HREF="#_uninstalling_sql_server_2000_components__d3jb">Uninstalling SQL Server 2000 Components and Desktop Engine SP3a</A>.</P>

<H5>Removing SQL Server Analysis Services Components SP3a</H5>

<P>To be able to return SQL Server Analysis Services to its pre-SP3a state, you must back up the registry key <B>HK_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\OLAP Server</B> and all of its sub-keys before installing SP3a. When uninstalling SP3a, you must delete this registry key and restore the pre-SP3a version from the backup.</P>

<UL type=disc>
	<LI>Database Components SP3a<BR><BR></LI>

	<LI>Analysis Services SP3a<BR><BR></LI>

	<LI>Desktop Engine SP3a</LI>
</UL>
</LI>

	<LI>In three self-extracting files that can be downloaded from the Internet at the <A HREF="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=4172" target=_blank>Microsoft SQL Server Downloads Web site</A>:
<UL type=disc>
	<LI>Sql2ksp3.exe (Database Components SP3a)<BR><BR></LI>

</UL>
</LI>
</UL>

<P class=indent><!--NOTE--><P ID="Alert_Note"><B>Note</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Both the SQL Server 2000 Service Pack 3a CD-ROM and Sql2kdesksp3.exe contain all of the files that are required to install a new instance of Desktop Engine. </P><!--/NOTE--></P>

<P class=indent><!--NOTE--><P ID="Alert_Note"><B>Note</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The download files for SP3a have the same names as the files for SP3. </P><!--/NOTE--></P>

<P>If you have an SP3a CD, you can install SP3a directly from the CD.</P>

<P>If you do not have an SP3a CD, you can download the appropriate file and then run it. When the download file is run on your computer, it will create a set of folders and files on your disk that have the same organization as the folders and files on the SP3a CD. After this file extraction phase is complete, you can install SP3a from the folders on your disk.</P>

<P>When downloading and extracting SP3a installation files from the Internet, use the following guidelines:

<UL type=disc>
	<LI>Download one of the files listed in section 2.0 and place the self-extracting file either in a folder on the computer that is running the SQL Server 2000 software that you are upgrading to SP3a, or in a folder on a network share. From that folder, run the file. The self-extraction program prompts you for the name of the folder into which you want the service pack files placed. 
<P class=atl><!--NOTE--><P ID="Alert_Note"><B>Note</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;When you extract the service pack to a network share, the path to the folder that you specify is relative to the folder in which you ran the self-extraction program.</P><!--/NOTE--></p></LI>

	<LI>On the local drive or network share to which you download the service pack installation files, you must have free space that is approximately three times the size of the self-extracting file. This includes space to store the self-extracting file, space for storing the extracted service pack files, and temporary working space required by the self-extraction program itself. <BR><BR></LI>

	<LI>You can rename or move the folder after extracting the components; however, make sure that the directory path name does not contain blank spaces. You can use the same target folder for each of the self-extracting files; they will not overwrite each other or interfere with each other.<BR><BR></LI>

	<LI>The self-extracting files are used to build a set of directories and files that are the same as those on the SP3a CD-ROM. If you download SP3a you must extract the files to build the service pack directories before you can run SQL Server Setup.<BR><BR></LI>

	<LI>For Database Components SP3a and Analysis Services SP3a, the setup process is the same for both the CD-ROM and the extracted files.</LI>
</UL>

<P class=indent><!--NOTE--><P ID="Alert_Note"><B>Note</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the files in the service packs are system files. You cannot view them unless you follow this procedure: In Windows Explorer, on the <B>View</B> menu, click <B>Options</B>, click the <B>View</B> tab, and then select the <B>Show all files</B> check box.</P><!--/NOTE--></P>

<H5>How to Determine the Language of an Instance of the SQL Server 2000 Database Engine or MSDE 2000</H5>

<P>SQL Server 2000 service packs are language-specific. To upgrade SQL Server 2000, you must download and apply the service pack that has the same language as your SQL Server 2000 software. For example, if you are upgrading an instance of MSDE 2000 that uses Japanese, you must download the Japanese version of Desktop Engine SP3a.</P>

<P>If you are unsure of the language of an instance of the SQL Server 2000 database engine or MSDE 2000:

<UL type=disc>
	<LI>Click <B>Start</B>, then click <B>Run</B>.<BR><BR></LI>

	<LI>In the <B>Open</B> box, type Regedit, then click <B>OK</B>.<BR><BR></LI>

	<LI>Locate and select one of the following keys:
<UL type=disc>
	<LI>For a default instance of the SQL Server 2000 database engine or MSDE 2000, locate and select this key:
<P class=tl>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\MSSQLServer\MSSQLServer\CurrentVersion</P></LI>

	<LI>For a named instance of the SQL Server 2000 database engine or MSDE 2000, locate and select this key:
<P class=tl>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Microsoft SQL Server\<I>InstanceName</I>\CurrentVersion</P>
<P class=tl>where <I>InstanceName</I> is the name of the instance.</P></LI>
</UL>
</LI>

	<LI>In the right pane, read the value of the <B>Language</B> entry. Compare that value to the following table to determine the language for your instance of the SQL Server 2000 database engine or MSDE 2000:

	<LI>The <B>Unsigned non-driver installation behavior</B> local security policy for Windows 2000</LI>
</UL>

<P>If you use the <B>Do not allow installation</B> setting, you must change it to <B>Silently succeed</B> before installing SP3a. If necessary, you can return the policy to its previous setting after the installation is complete.</P>

<P class=indent><!--NOTE--><P ID="Alert_Note"><B>Note</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Do not allow installation</B> is not the default setting for these security policies.</P><!--/NOTE--></P>

<P>When installing SQL Server 2000 SP3a on a computer running Windows XP, MDAC 2.7 will not be updated to MDAC 2.7 Service Pack 1a (SP1a). If your system requires any of the fixes included in MDAC 2.7 SP1a, you must first apply Windows XP Service Pack 1 before you install SQL Server 2000 SP3a. Windows XP SP1 will apply all the fixes included in MDAC 2.7 SP1a.</P>

<P>When installing this service pack on a pre-release version of Microsoft Windows Server 2003 build 3683 or older, you will receive the following error message:</P>

<P>Before you install SP3a on the French version of Windows NT 4.0, follow the instructions in Knowledge Base article <A HREF="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=9327" target=_blank>259484</A>. You can access the article from the <A HREF="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=3930" target=_blank>Microsoft Product Support Services Knowledge Base</A>. For instructions on searching the Knowledge Base, see Section 1.5 <A HREF="#_additional_information_about_sp3">Additional Information About SP3a</A>.</P>

<H5>Before Starting a Database Components Installation</H5>

<P>If you apply Database Components SP3a to an instance of SQL Server on a computer on which Analysis Services is also installed, Setup may fail when executing the script, Sp3_serv_uni.sql. If this happens, restart the computer and run Setup again.

<UL type=disc>
	<LI>SQL Server 2000 service packs do not affect the ability to back up user databases from one release (original release or a service pack) of SQL Server 2000 or MSDE 2000 and restore them on another release, except when the user database is part of a replication topology. If the user database is not part of a replication topology, you can back it up from an instance running any release of SQL Server 2000 or MSDE 2000, and restore it on an instance running any other release of SQL Server 2000 or MSDE 2000. There are additional considerations for replication that are detailed in section 5.3.6 <A HREF="#_backup_and_restore_issues_for_merge_replication">Backup and Restore Issues for Merge Replication</A></LI>
</UL>

<P>SP3a Setup upgrades user databases that are members of a replication topology. Before installing SP3a, make sure that replication databases and filegroups are writable and that the user account that is running Setup has permission to access the databases. For more information about applying SP3a to databases that are included in replication topologies, see Section 3.11 <A HREF="#_installing_on_replicated_servers">Installing on Replicated Servers</A>.</P>

<P>If SP3a Setup detects user databases or filegroups that are not writable, it:

<UL type=disc>
	<LI>Applies the SP3a replication updates to all writable user databases.<BR><BR></LI>

	<LI>Writes a list of the non-writable databases to the Setup log, which is located at Winnt\Sqlsp.log.<BR><BR></LI>

	<LI>Displays the following warning message:
<PRE><CODE>Setup has detected one or more databases and filegroups which are not writable.</CODE></PRE>
</LI>
</UL>

<P>You can ignore this warning unless some of the databases listed in the Setup log are members of a replication topology. If any of the non-writable databases listed in the Setup log are members of a replication topology, you must make those databases writable and reapply SP3a Setup to that instance of SQL Server 2000. </P>

<P class=indent><!--NOTE--><P ID="Alert_Note"><B>Note</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;This message does not affect unattended installations. For more information about unattended installations, see Section 4.1 <A HREF="#_unattended_installations">Unattended Installations</A>.</P><!--/NOTE--></P>

<P>For more information about making a database writable, see Section 3.12 <A HREF="#_applying_sp3_to_read-only_databases_or_filegroups">Applying SP3a to Read-Only Databases or Filegroups</A>. For more information about reapplying SP3a, see Section 3.14 <A HREF="#_reapplying_sp3">Reapplying SP3a</A>.</P>

<P>Because non-writeable databases no longer cause Setup to fail, you do not have to remove log shipping before upgrading to SP3a. However, if the database is shipping logs to a database that is a replication publisher, you must:

<OL>
	<LI>Take the database offline before applying SP3a.<BR><BR></LI>

	<LI>Apply SP3a to the instance.<BR><BR></LI>

	<LI>Bring the database back online.<BR><BR></LI>

	<LI>Log on to Query Analyzer and run the following script:
<PRE><CODE>USE master
GO
EXEC sp_vpupgrade_replication
GO</CODE></PRE>
</LI>
</OL>

<P>If you apply SP3a without having taken offline all non-writeable databases shipping logs to publication databases, you will receive this error:</P>

<P>Error Running Script sp_vpupgrade_replication (1)</P>

<P>If you receive this error, follow the procedure above.</P>

<P class=indent><!--NOTE--><P ID="Alert_Note"><B>Note</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;During installation, Setup makes no distinction between read-only databases and databases that are offline or in a suspect state. If a replication database or filegroup is in any of these conditions during setup and is involved in a replication topology, you must reapply the service pack after making the database writable.</P><!--/NOTE--></P>

<P class=indent><!--NOTE--><P ID="Alert_Note"><B>Note</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Because non-writable databases no longer cause Setup to fail, you do not have to remove log shipping before upgrading to SP3a.</P><!--/NOTE--></P>

<H5>Preparing for a Systems Management Server Distributed Installation</H5>

<P>You cannot install SQL Server 2000 Service Pack 3a remotely. However, you can use Microsoft Systems Management Server to install SP3a automatically on multiple computers running Windows NT Server 4.0. To do so, you must use a package definition file (Smssql2ksp3.pdf) that automates the creation of a SQL Server package in Systems Management Server. The SQL Server package can then be distributed and installed on computers that are running Systems Management Server. The file Sms2kdef.bat is a batch file that starts an unattended setup using Systems Management Server. In this type of installation, the Setup program automatically detects relevant system information that it needs and no user input is required.</P>

<P class=indent><!--NOTE--><P ID="Alert_Note"><B>Note</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;You cannot use Systems Management Server to install Desktop Engine SP3a.</P><!--/NOTE--></P>

<H2><A NAME="_back_up_your_sql_server_databases"></A>3.1 Back Up Your SQL Server Databases</H2>

<P>The following information applies to all component installations except database client components.</P>

<P>Before installing either Database Components SP3a or Desktop Engine SP3a, back up the <B>master</B>, <B>msdb</B>, and <B>model </B>databases. Installing SP3a modifies the <B>master</B>, <B>msdb</B>, and <B>model </B>databases, making them incompatible with pre-SP3 versions of SQL Server. These backups are required if you decide to reinstall SQL Server 2000 without SP3 or SP3a.</P>

<P>It is also prudent to back up your user databases, although SP3a performs updates only on user databases that are members of replication topologies.</P>

<H2><A NAME="_back_up_your_analysis_services_databases"></A>3.2 Back Up Your Analysis Services Databases and Repository</H2>

<P>The following information applies only to Analysis Services.</P>

<P>Before installing Analysis Services SP3a, back up your Analysis Services databases by making a copy of the Microsoft Analysis Services\Data folder, which is installed by default under the C:\Program Files folder. If you have not migrated your Analysis Services repository to SQL Server, make a backup copy of the file Msmdrep.mdb, which is located in the Microsoft Analysis Services\Bin folder. You should also save your Analysis server registry entries by running <B>Regedit.exe</B> and by using the <B>Export Registry File</B> item on the <B>Registry</B> menu to export the key <B>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\OLAP Server</B> to a file for backup. If you have migrated your Analysis Services repository to SQL Server, back up the database that contains the repository before installing SP3a. For more information, see <A HREF="#_uninstalling_sql_server_2000_analysis_se_wluf">Uninstalling SQL Server 2000 Analysis Services SP3a</A>.</P>

<H2><A NAME="_make_sure_that_the_system_databases_have_enough_free_space"></A>3.3 Make Sure the System Databases Have Enough Free Space</H2>

<P>The following information applies to all component installations except database client components and Analysis Services.</P>

<P>If the <B>autogrow</B> option is not selected for the <B>master</B> and <B>msdb</B> databases, the databases must have at least 500 kilobytes (KB) of free space. To verify that they have this space, run the <B>sp_spaceused</B> system stored procedure for the <B>master</B> or <B>msdb</B> database. If the unallocated space in either database is less than 500 KB, increase the size of the database. For more information, see "Expanding a Database" in SQL Server Books Online.</P>

<P>If the <B>autogrow</B> option is selected for the <B>master</B> and <B>msdb</B> databases, and there is sufficient room on the drives, you can skip this step.</P>

<P>To verify that the <B>autogrow</B> option is selected in SQL Server 2000, open SQL Server Enterprise Manager, right-click the icon for the database, and then click <B>Properties</B>. Verify that the <B>Automatically grow file</B> check box is selected. </P>

<P>To verify that this option is selected in MSDE 2000, use the <B>osql</B> command prompt utility to issue the following SQL statements:

<UL type=disc>
	<LI><B>sp_helpdb master</B><BR><BR></LI>

	<LI><B>sp_helpdb msdb</B></LI>

<H2><A NAME="_stop_services_and_applications_before_running_sp3_setup"></A>3.4 Stop Services and Applications Before Running SP3a Setup</H2>

<P>The following information applies to all components.</P>

<P>You can apply SP3a without shutting down services. If you do not shut down services, you are prompted to reboot the computer when Setup is complete. Without rebooting, the following services fail to start:

<UL type=disc>
	<LI>Microsoft Distributed Transaction Coordinator (MS DTC) and the Microsoft Search and MSSQLServerOLAPService services.<BR><BR></LI>

	<LI>Microsoft Component Services, Microsoft Message Queuing, and Microsoft COM Transaction Integrator.<BR><BR></LI>

	<LI>All applications, including Control Panel. (optional)</LI>
</UL>

<P>You can apply SP3a without restarting your computer by stopping these services and applications before applying the SP3a.</P>

<P>You cannot stop the services in a clustered environment. For more information, see Section 3.10 <A HREF="#_installing_on_a_failover_cluster">Installing on a Failover Cluster</A>.</P>

<H2><A NAME="_install_database_components_sp3"></A>3.5 Install Database Components SP3a</H2>

<H5>Additional Analysis Services Installation Issues</H5>

<P>After installing Analysis Services SP3a you must also upgrade any computers used for remote administration to SP3 or SP3a. Otherwise, you receive the following error message when you attempt to connect remotely through Analysis Manager:</P>

<PRE><CODE>Unable to connect to the registry on the server (server_name), or you 
are not a member of the OLAP Administrators group of this server.</CODE></PRE>

<P>Meta Data Services has added a new dedicated role named <B>RepositoryUser</B>, which can be used to access and update repository information in the <B>msdb</B> database. The <B>RepositoryUser</B> role has create, read, update, delete, and execute permissions on the <B>msdb </B>repository. The <B>public</B> role has been replaced by this new role and no longer has permissions on this repository. If the following conditions are met, the <B>OLAP Administrators</B> group must be added to the <B>RepositoryUser</B> role so that members of this group can access the repository after the service pack is applied:

<P>The following information applies only to Desktop Engine (MSDE 2000).</P>

<P>Desktop Engine SP3a contains a complete set of the files required to install or upgrade instances of SQL Server 2000 Desktop Engine (MSDE 2000). You can perform all of the MSDE 2000 setup actions with the files from Desktop Engine SP3a, provided you have a license to install or upgrade an instance of MSDE 2000. For more information about MSDE 2000 licensing, see <A HREF="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=10253" target=_blank>Uses of MSDE 2000</A>.</P>

<P>You may not be able to apply Desktop Engine SP3a to instances of MSDE 2000 that were installed by the setup utility of an application. You must contact the application provider for a patch file that can be used to upgrade these instances of MSDE 2000. For instructions on how to determine if an instance of MSDE 2000 falls into this category, see section 2.1 <A HREF="#_2461_downloading_and_extracting_desktop__fzpy">Downloading and Extracting Desktop Engine (MSDE 2000) SP3a</A>.</P>

<H3><A NAME="_3467461_prerequisites_for_msde_2000_sp3_d3jb"></A>3.7.1 Prerequisites for MSDE 2000 SP3a</H3>

<P>The following information applies only to Desktop Engine (MSDE 2000).</P>

<P>The following requirements apply to SQL Server 2000 Desktop Engine (MSDE 2000) SP3a installations.</P>

<P>When upgrading MSDE 2000, you must separately apply Desktop Engine SP3a to every instance of MSDE 2000.</P>

<P class=atl><!--NOTE--><P ID="Alert_Note"><B>Note</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Microsoft does not support configurations where there are more than 16 instances of the database engine on one computer. This includes instances of SQL Server 6.5, SQL Server 7.0, SQL Server 2000, MSDE 1.0, and MSDE 2000.</P><!--/NOTE--></p>
<P>Always start the MSDE 2000 Setup by running Setup.exe. Do not start Setup by directly invoking one of the MSDE 2000 .msi files, such as by double-clicking one of the MSDE 2000 .msi files. You must run Setup from the command prompt and specify parameters to install or upgrade any instance of MSDE. For more information on the required parameters, see sections 3.7.2 through 3.7.6.</P>

<P>Problems can occur if you use a Terminal Services connection to attempt to upgrade an existing instance of MSDE to SP3a, or to install a new instance of MSDE 2000 SP3a. If problems are encountered, restart Setup from the local computer.</P>

<P>You must know the instance name of the instance of MSDE you are installing or upgrading using the MSDE 2000 SP3a setup. If you are installing or upgrading a named instance of MSDE, you must use the INSTANCENAME parameter to specify the instance name. If you do not specify INSTANCENAME, Setup operates on the default instance of MSDE on that computer. In versions of MSDE 2000 Setup before SP3, users needed to specify the .msi installation package file used to install or upgrade an instance of MSDE 2000. In SP3 and later versions of Setup, Setup manages the .msi files and you do not need to specify the .msi file for either an upgrade or a new installation.</P>

<P>You can run the MSDE 2000 SP3a Setup from your hard drive, a network share, or a CD-ROM. When upgrading an instance of MSDE 2000 to SP3a, you can only run Setup from a network share or a CD-ROM if the original files used to install the instance of MSDE 2000 are still present in the location they occupied during the original installation. If the original installation was from a CD-ROM, MSDE 2000 SP3a setup will request the original CD-ROM during the upgrade. If the original files are no longer in their original location, or the original CD-ROM is not available, you must copy the MSDE 2000 SP3a files to your hard drive and run Setup from there.</P>

<P>If you create your own CD-ROM for installing SP3a, the volume label on the CD-ROM must be <I>SQL2KSP3</I>. If you are an independent software vendor (ISV) creating a CD-ROM for the purpose of distributing Desktop Engine as a component of your application, the CD-ROM volume label must be identical to the <B>VolumeLabel</B> property in the <B>Media</B> table of the Windows Installer package (*.msi).</P>

<P>You can install the upgrade for Desktop Engine from a CD-ROM only if you are using Windows Installer version 2.0.2600.0 or later.If you need to upgrade Windows Installer, SP3a includes the files needed to upgrade Windows Installer.</P>

<P class=label><B>To upgrade Windows Installer:</B>

<H3><A NAME="_3467462_security_considerations_for_msde_d3jb"></A>3.7.2 Security Considerations for MSDE 2000 SP3a</H3>

<P>The following information applies only to Desktop Engine (MSDE 2000).</P>

<P>The behavior of MSDE 2000 setup has been changed in SP3a so that the default settings result in a more secure configuration.</P>

<P>Desktop Engine SP3a changes the default behavior of the DISABLENETWORKPROTOCOLS setup parameter that specifies the configuration of the network connection support for an instance of MSDE 2000. If no application running on another computer will connect to your instance of MSDE 2000, the instance has no need for network support and it is prudent to turn off a resource that is not being used. SP3a will turn off the network support by default when installing new instances of MSDE 2000. If you disable the network support when installing an instance of MSDE 2000 SP3a, you can later reconfigure the instance to enable the support. For more information about disabling and restoring network access, see Microsoft Knowledge Base article <A HREF="http://support.microsoft.com?kbid=814130" target=_blank>814130</A>.</P>

<P>By default, the MSDE 2000 SP3a setup will not install a new instance of MSDE 2000 unless you use the SAPWD parameter to specify a strong <B>sa</B> password. By default, the MSDE 2000 SP3a setup will not upgrade an existing instance of MSDE 2000 unless you have assigned a strong password to the <B>sa</B> login. You should assign a strong password to the <B>sa</B> login, even when upgrading an existing instance, unless the application using your instance of MSDE depends in some way on a null <B>sa</B> password. Even if the instance of MSDE 2000 is running in Windows Authentication mode, the <B>sa</B> login becomes immediately active if the instance is ever switched to Mixed Mode. A null, blank, simple, or well-known <B>sa</B> password could be used for unauthorized access. If you need to assign a strong <B>sa</B> password before upgrading your instance of MSDE 2000 to SP3a, see Microsoft Knowledge Base article <A HREF="http://support.microsoft.com?kbid=322336" target=_blank>322336</A>.</P>

<P>Whenever possible, for greater security, use Windows Authentication with your MSDE 2000 installation. Consider switching from Mixed Mode to Windows Authentication Mode if:

<UL type=disc>
	<LI>The applications using MSDE 2000 can run using Windows Authentication.<BR><BR></LI>

	<LI>You have defined Windows Authentication logins for all users who need to connect to the instance. For more information about adding logins, see <B>Adding a Windows User or Group</B> in the SQL Server 2000 Books Online.<BR><BR></LI>

	<LI>The instance of MSDE 2000 is not running on Windows 98 or Windows ME.</LI>
</UL>

<P>For more information on changing an instance of MSDE 2000 from Mixed Mode to Windows Authentication Mode, see Microsoft Knowledge Base article <A HREF="http://support.microsoft.com?kbid=322336" target=_blank>322336</A>.</P>

<H3><A NAME="_3467463_msde_2000_setup_parameters_wluf"></A>3.7.3 MSDE 2000 Setup Parameters</H3>

<P>The following information applies only to Desktop Engine (MSDE 2000).</P>

<P>MSDE 2000 is designed to be distributed with applications and installed by the setup program of the application. MSDE 2000 does not have an interactive setup program. The setup mechanisms for MSDE 2000 are designed to be called by an application setup utility, where any required interaction with the end-user is handled by the application setup. MSDE 2000 has two installation mechanisms:

<UL type=disc>
	<LI>A command prompt Setup utility. The setup utility is usually called by an application setup utility, but can also be run from a command prompt window. The MSDE 2000 setup utility does not have a graphical user interface through which a user can control the behavior of the utility. Instead, this utility accepts a set of parameters that define what actions the utility should take.<BR><BR></LI>

	<LI>A set of Windows Installer merge modules. Developers who write Windows Installer-based setup utilities can code their application setup to install an instance MSDE 2000 by consuming the MSDE 2000 merge modules. Developers can control the configuration of the installed instance by specifying installation package properties that correspond to the MSDE 2000 setup utility parameters.</LI>
</UL>

<P>Users can use the command prompt MSDE 2000 Setup utility to either upgrade existing instances of MSDE or to install new instances of MSDE 2000. Users control the behavior of the MSDE 2000 Setup program by specifying parameters. The setup parameters can be specified in one of two ways:

<UL type=disc>
	<LI>On the command line.<BR><BR></LI>

	<LI>In an .ini file read by the Setup utility.</LI>
</UL>

<P>Most of the parameters supported by the MSDE 2000 SP3a version of Setup are documented in the topic "Customizing Desktop Engine Setup.exe" in SQL Server 2000 Books Online (Updated &#0150; SP3). For more information about installing SQL Server 2000 Books Online, see section 1.6 <A HREF="#_updated_books_online_documentation_is_av_wluf">Updated Books Online Documentation Is Available</A></P>

<P>You must enclose the values for MSDE Setup parameters in double quotation marks if the value specified has special characters, such as blanks. Otherwise the quotation marks are optional.</P>

<P>These MSDE 2000 SP3a Setup parameters are either not documented in the SQL Server 2000 Books Online (Updated &#0150; SP3), or behave differently than described in the Books Online.</P>

<H5>Distributing Desktop Engine SP3a Patches</H5>

<P>If an application has a Windows Installer-based setup utility, it can install an instance of MSDE 2000 by consuming the MSDE 2000 merge modules. Desktop Engine (MSDE 2000) SP3a provides merge modules to support existing applications that use merge modules. The Setup utilities for new applications should be written to call the MSDE 2000 Setup utility instead of directly consuming the MSDE 2000 merge modules.</P>

<P>Vendors who choose to install instances of MSDE 2000 using the MSDE 2000 merge modules must also supply all subsequent MSDE 2000 patches to their customers. Instances of MSDE 2000 installed using merge modules are marked with a product code GUID associated with the application by Windows Installer. Only patch files that also contain the application product code GUID can patch those instances of MSDE 2000. Only patch files produced by the application vendor will contain the proper product codes. The Desktop Engine (MSDE 2000) service packs supplied by Microsoft cannot be applied to those instances. The application vendor must build patch files using the Desktop Engine SP3a files and distribute those patch files to any of their MSDE customers who need the fixes in SP3a.</P>

<P>For more information about creating patch packages, see the documentation included with the Windows Installer Software Development Kit (SDK), which can be downloaded from the <A HREF="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=4435" target=_blank>Microsoft Platform SDK Web site</A>.</P>

<P>If an application setup utility installs an instance of MSDE 2000 by calling the MSDE 2000 setup utility, the instance of MSDE 2000 is marked with the MSDE 2000 product code GUID. Customers can patch these instances using the standard Microsoft MSDE 2000 service pack files. The application vendor can choose one of the following alternatives for distributing MSDE 2000 SP3a:

<UL type=disc>
	<LI>Instruct their customers to install Desktop Engine SP3a from either the SQL Server 2000 SP3a download page or a SQL Server 2000 SP3a CD<BR><BR></LI>

	<LI>Download the SQL2KDeskSP3.exe download file and distribute that to their customers with instructions on how to apply the service pack.<BR><BR></LI>

	<LI>Using the Desktop Engine SP3a files, build a service pack application utility that will install SP3a on the instances of MSDE 2000 installed by the application.</LI>
</UL>

<P>Application vendors who elect to instruct their customers to apply SP3a directly should develop a set of instructions customized to the needs of their customers.</P>

<P>For examples of the types of MSDE 2000 service pack instructions Microsoft application teams prepared for their customers, see this <A HREF="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=14961" target=_blank>Microsoft MSDE Applications Web page</A></P>

<H5>Installing SP3a on a Server that Acts as a Publisher and a Subscriber</H5>

<P>For replication topologies based on merge replication or transactional replication with updating Subscribers that include one or more servers that act as both a Subscriber and a Publisher (or Distributor), you might need to quiesce the system (in other words, stop all updates) and upgrade all servers simultaneously. </P>

<H6>Example 1: Topology That Requires Simultaneous Upgrades</H6>

<P>The following table includes servers that both publish and subscribe to publications that allow updates at the Subscriber. As noted earlier, you must follow the upgrade order Distributor, Publisher, Subscriber for topologies that allow updates at the Subscriber. This order requires you to upgrade Server A first for the merge publication and Server B first for the transactional publication with updating Subscribers. In this case, you must quiesce the system and upgrade the servers simultaneously.</P>

<P>If you are using merge replication and the Distributor is located on another computer or database instance (a remote Distributor), after applying SP3a you must generate a new snapshot.</P>

<P>SP3a introduces a change in the requirements for attaching or restoring replication databases. For more information, see Section 5.3.17 <A HREF="#_change_to_requirements_for_attaching_40o_wluf">Change to Requirements for Attaching or Restoring a Replication Database</A>.</P>

<P>SP3a Setup upgrades user databases that are members of a replication topology. If any of the databases that are members of a replication topology are non-writable, to apply SP3a to those databases you must make them writable, and then reapply SP3a Setup. For more information about making a database writable, see Section 3.12 <A HREF="#_applying_sp3_to_read-only_databases_or_filegroups">Applying SP3a to Read-Only Databases or Filegroups</A>. For information about reapplying SP3a, see Section 3.14 <A HREF="#_reapplying_sp3">Reapplying SP3a</A>.</P>

<P>An existing backup scheme that accounts for replication allows you to restore a database to a known point after the SP3a upgrade in case of a failure. After applying SP3a, a log or full database backup is recommended for any user database that is included in a replication topology. This way, if a replication database fails, you do not have to reapply SP3a after the database is restored.</P>

<P>Database Components SP3a can be applied in unattended mode to an instance of SQL Server. The Database Components SP3a CD-ROM contains .iss files that can be used to perform unattended SP3a setups and other types of installations. The following files are located in the root directory on the CD-ROM:

<UL type=disc>
	<LI>Sql2kdef.iss is the unattended setup file used to apply Database Components SP3a to a default instance of SQL Server 2000 running on Windows 2000 or Windows NT 4.0. The corresponding batch file to use is Sql2kdef.bat. <BR><BR></LI>

	<LI>Sql2knm.iss is the setup file used to apply Database Components SP3a to a named instance of SQL Server 2000 running on Windows 2000 or Windows NT 4.0. You must change the instance name in this .iss file to identify the instance that is being upgraded.<BR><BR></LI>

	<LI>Sql2ktls.iss is the setup file used to apply Database Components SP3a to a tools-only installation. This file can be used for installation without any modifications.<BR><BR></LI>

<P>For more information about performing unattended installations of SQL Server 2000, see the topic "Performing an Unattended Installation" in SQL Server Books Online.</P>

<H5>Unattended Installation Considerations</H5>

<P>The following considerations relate to unattended installations:

<UL type=disc>
	<LI>Run unattended installations using Windows Authentication whenever possible. <BR><BR></LI>

	<LI>If you must run an unattended setup using SQL Server Authentication; for example if you are running an unattended setup of SP3a on a computer running Windows 98 or Windows Millennium Edition, you should not include a password for the sa login in the .iss file or batch file because these files are not encrypted. Instead, you should supply the password for the sa login in the command line using the <I>sapwd</I> parameter as follows:
<PRE><CODE>start /wait setupsql.exe -s -sms -f1 C:\sql2knm.iss -sapwd <I>password</I> </CODE></PRE>
</LI>

	<LI>If the SQL Server instance being upgraded to SP3a has a blank password for the sa login account, a password must be provided prior to running an unattended installation. You should change this password by running <B>sp_password</B>.<BR><BR></LI>

	<LI>When running an unattended installation of SP3a, you must manually set the following setup switches that correspond to the <B>Backward Compatibility Checklist</B> dialog box or the unattended installation will fail.</LI>

<H2><A NAME="_database_and_desktop_engine_enhancements"></A>5.1 Database and Desktop Engine Enhancements</H2>

<P>The following enhancements apply to SQL Server 2000 instances on which Database Components SP3a is installed. They also apply to MSDE 2000 instances on which Desktop Engine SP3a is installed.</P>

<H3><A NAME="_using_chinese_japanese_or_korean_characters_with_database_components sp3"></A>5.1.1 Using Chinese, Japanese, or Korean Characters with Database Components SP3a</H3>

<P><I>Introduced in SP1</I></P>

<P>If you install Database Components SP3a on a server running Windows NT 4.0 or Windows 98 and later upgrade to Windows 2000, the Windows 2000 upgrade replaces certain system files. These system files are necessary for sorting Chinese, Japanese, or Korean characters. If you use Chinese, Japanese, or Korean characters in your SQL Server databases, rerun the version of Sqlredis.exe included with SP3a after you upgrade to Windows 2000. For more information about running Sqlredis.exe, see Section 4.2 <A HREF="#_redistributing_database_components_sp3_client_components">Redistributing SP3a Data Access Components</A>.</P>

<P class=indent><!--NOTE--><P ID="Alert_Note"><B>Note</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;You do not have to reapply Sqlredis.exe on client computers or on servers that do not have databases containing Chinese, Japanese, or Korean characters.</P><!--/NOTE--></P>

<H3><A NAME="_hash_teams_removed"></A>5.1.2 Hash Teams Removed</H3>

<P><I>Introduced in SP1</I></P>

<P>Hash teams have been removed. Because of certain enhancements to SQL Server 2000, hash teams no longer produce the performance benefits they offered in SQL Server 7.0. In addition, removing hash teams makes SQL Server 2000 more stable. </P>

<P>Therefore, the query optimizer no longer generates query plans using hash teams.</P>

<P>In rare cases, the removal of hash teams can cause a query to be processed more slowly. Analyze such queries to see whether creating more suitable indexes will return query performance to its previous level.</P>

<H3><A NAME="_affinity_mask_switches_added"></A>5.1.3 Affinity Mask Switches Added</H3>

<P><I>Introduced in SP1</I></P>

<P>Two affinity mask switches have been added to this service pack.</P>

<H5>Affinity Mask I/O Switch</H5>

<P>With this service pack, you can specify which CPUs are used to run threads for disk I/O operations. This switch must be used in conjunction with the <B>affinity mask</B> option. For more information, see article <A HREF="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=9329" target=_blank>298402</A> in the <A HREF="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=3930" target=_blank>Microsoft Product Support Services Knowledge Base</A>. For instructions on searching the Knowledge Base, see Section 1.5 <A HREF="#_additional_information_about_sp3">Additional Information About SP3a</A>.</P>

<H5>Affinity Mask Connection Switch</H5>

<P>With this service pack, you can configure systems that are enabled for Virtual Interface Architecture (VIA) to bind the SQL Server connections from certain network cards to a processor or a set of processors. This switch must be used in conjunction with the <B>affinity mask</B> option. For more information, see article <A HREF="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=9330" target=_blank>299641</A> in the <A HREF="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=3930" target=_blank>Microsoft Product Support Services Knowledge Base</A>. </P>

<H3><A NAME="_filtered_indexed_view"></A>5.1.4 Filtered Indexed View</H3>

<P><I>Introduced in SP2</I></P>

<P>If you have encountered SQL Server 2000 bug 355069 as documented in Microsoft Knowledge Base Article <A HREF="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=9331" target=_blank>306467</A>, this service pack will only prevent future occurrences of unexpected results because of data modifications. In addition to applying this fix, all indexes that are based on views with filter conditions must be re-created. For more information, see the <A HREF="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=3930" target=_blank>Microsoft Product Support Services Knowledge Base</A>. </P>

<H3><A NAME="_full-text_catalogs_will_be_rebuilt_after_setup_completes"></A>5.1.5 Full-Text Catalogs Are Rebuilt After Setup Completes</H3>

<P><I>Introduced in SP3</I></P>

<P>All full-text catalogs are rebuilt as part of the installation of SP3a, except when upgrading from SP3. The rebuild is automatic and resource-intensive. Queries against full-text catalogs may return partial results or no results until the rebuild process is complete. After SP3a is installed, the system event logs contain messages stating that the catalogs were corrupt, of an older version, and had to be rebuilt. </P>

<P>For information , see the Knowledge Base article <A HREF="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=11588" target=_blank>327217</A>, which also discusses possible workarounds for keeping full-text search available during the rebuild process and to avoid an automatic rebuild. </P>

<H3><A NAME="_syntax_changes_for_sp_change_users_login_wluf"></A>5.1.6 Syntax Changes for sp_change_users_login </H3>

<P><I>Introduced in SP3</I></P>

<P>When you run <B>sp_change_users_login</B> with the <B>@Action=Auto_Fix</B> argument, you must now specify a password. <B>sp_change_users_login</B> assigns the password to any new login it creates for the user. The following example shows the new <B>@Password</B> argument:</P>

<PRE><CODE>sp_change_users_login [ @Action = ] 'action' 
    [ , [ @UserNamePattern = ] 'user' ] 
    [ , [ @LoginName = ] 'login' ]
    [ , [ @Password = ] 'password' ]</CODE></PRE>

<P>Use the <B>@Password</B> argument only with <B>@Action=Auto_Fix</B>. The following example shows the new syntax for the <B>sp_change_users_login</B> command when using <B>Auto_Fix</B>. Other examples in SQL Server Books Online remain unchanged.</P>

<PRE><CODE>USE pubs
go
EXEC sp_change_users_login 'Auto_Fix', 'Mary', NULL, 'B3r12-36'
go</CODE></PRE>

<H3><A NAME="_ad_hoc_access_to_ole_db_providers_disabl_fzpy"></A>5.1.7 Ad Hoc Access to OLE DB Providers Disabled by Default</H3>

<P><I>Introduced in SP3</I></P>

<P>If the <B>DisallowAdhocAccess</B> registry option is not explicitly set, by default, ad hoc access to OLE DB providers is not allowed. This means ad hoc query syntax, such as OPENDATASOURCE and OPENROWSET, will not work against remote servers. To allow ad hoc access, you must explicitly set the <B>DisallowAdhocAccess</B> option to <B>0</B>.</P>

<H3><A NAME="_new_sqlserverlike_provider_option_cuy1"></A>5.1.8 New SqlServerLike Provider Option</H3>

<P><I>Introduced in SP3</I></P>

<P>To enable more efficient processing of remote queries that include LIKE predicates, the <B>SqlServerLike</B> option was added in SP3. SQL Server 2000 SP3 or later now has two options for sending LIKE operations to linked servers. If the OLE DB provider for a linked server supports the SQL Server syntax for the LIKE operator and wildcards, you can specify the <B>SqlServerLIKE</B> option to have SQL Server send LIKE operations using SQL Server syntax. If the OLE DB provider for a linked server reports that it supports the Entry Level ANSI/ISO SQL-92 syntax or returns the <B>SQLPROP_ANSILIKE </B>property, SQL Server will send LIKE operations to the linked server using SQL-92 syntax. For more information on <B>SQLPROP_ANSILIKE</B>, see the topic "Programming the SQLPROPSET_OPTHINTS Property Set" in SQL Server 2000 Books Online.</P>

<P>You must add a registry key value to enable the <B>SqlServerLIKE</B> option for an OLE DB provider.</P>

<P><!--CAUTION--><P ID="Alert_Caution"><B CLASS="notes">Caution</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Incorrectly editing the registry can cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems resulting from editing the registry incorrectly can be resolved. Before editing the registry, back up any valuable data.</P><!--/CAUTION-->

<H3><A NAME="_expanded_error_messages_for_distributed__d3jb"></A>5.1.9 Expanded Error Messages for Distributed Queries</H3>

<P><I>Introduced in SP3</I></P>

<P>For distributed queries, SQL Server returns provider error information in addition to server error information. When a query between linked servers results in an error, SQL Server checks to see if the provider supports the <B>IErrorRecords</B> OLE DB interface. If this interface is supported, SQL Server calls the <B>GetErrorInfo</B> function to get additional error information from the provider and returns this information to the user as part of the error message. If the <B>IErrorRecords</B> interface is not supported, there is no change in SQL Server behavior: SQL Server returns a generic error.</P>

<P>For example, run the following query against a server that uses MSDASQL, which does not support <B>sql_variant</B>:</P>

<PRE><CODE>SELECT * FROM remote2k.dqtable.dbo.sqlvariantnotnull 
--Remote2k is a loopback server.</CODE></PRE>

<P>Prior to SP3, SQL Server returned the following error message:</P>

<PRE><CODE>Server: Msg 7356, Level 16, State 1, Line 1
OLE DB provider 'msdasql' supplied inconsistent metadata for a column. 
Metadata information was changed at execution time.</CODE></PRE>

<P>After you apply SP3 or later, SQL Server returns the following error message:</P>

<PRE><CODE>Server: Msg 7356, Level 16, State 1, Line 1
OLE DB provider 'msdasql' supplied inconsistent metadata for a column. 
Metadata information was changed at execution time.
OLE DB error trace [Non-interface error:  Column 'sql_variant' (compile-time

<H5>Remarks</H5>

<P>You can get a valid SQL handle from the <B>sql_handle </B>column of the <B>sysprocesses </B>system table.</P>

<P>If you pass a handle that no longer exists in cache, <B>fn_get_sql</B> returns an empty result set. If you pass a handle that is not valid, the batch stops, and the following error message is returned:</P>

<P><CODE>Server: Msg 569, Level 16, State 1, Procedure fn_get_sql, Line 12 The handle passed to fn_get_sql was invalid. </CODE></P>

<P>SQL Server 2000 cannot cache some Transact-SQL statements, such as bulk copy statements and statements with string literals larger than 8 KB. You cannot retrieve handles to those statements by using the <B>fn_get_sql</B> function.</P>

<P>The <B>text </B>column of the result set is filtered for text that may contain passwords. </P>

<P>The information returned by the <B>fn_get_sql</B> function is similar to the DBCC INPUTBUFFER command. Use the <B>fn_get_sql</B> function when the DBCC INPUTBUFFER cannot be used, for example:

<UL type=disc>
	<LI>When events have more than 255 characters.<BR><BR></LI>

	<LI>When you have to return the highest current nesting level of a stored procedure. For example, there are two stored procedures that are named <B>sp_1 </B>and <B>sp_2</B>. If <B>sp_1 </B>calls <B>sp_2</B> and you get the handle from the <B>sysprocesses </B>system table while <B>sp_2 </B>is running, the fn_get_sql function returns information about <B>sp_2</B>. Additionally, the fn_get_sql function returns the complete text of the stored procedure at the highest current nesting level.</LI>
</UL>

<H5>Permissions</H5>

<P>Only members of the <B>sysadmin </B>fixed server role can run the <B>fn_get_sql</B> function. </P>

<H5>Examples</H5>

<P>Database administrators can use the <B>fn_get_sql</B> function to help diagnose problem processes. After an administrator identifies a problem server process ID (SPID), the administrator can retrieve the SQL handle for that SPID, call the <B>fn_get_sql</B> function with the handle, and use the start and end offsets to determine the SQL text of the problem SPID. For example: </P>

<PRE><CODE>DECLARE @Handle binary(20)
SELECT @Handle = sql_handle FROM sysprocesses WHERE spid = 52
SELECT * FROM ::fn_get_sql(@Handle) </CODE></PRE>

<H3><A NAME="_enabling_cross45database_ownership_chain_ar5q"></A>5.1.11 Cross-Database Ownership Chaining</H3>

<H3><A NAME="_54614615_turning_off_udp_port_1434_d3jb"></A>5.1.15 Operations On UDP Port 1434</H3>

<P><I>Introduced in SP3a</I></P>

<P>Starting with SQL Server 2000 SP3a, instances of the SQL Server 2000 database engine and MSDE 2000 that are not configured to support network communications will stop using User Datagram Protocol (UDP) port 1434. Instances that are configured to support network communications will use UDP 1434.</P>

<P>An instance upgraded to SP3a will stop using UDP 1434 whenever all of the server Net-Libraries for the instance, except the shared memory Net-Library, are disabled. The instance will start using port 1434 whenever you enable any of the server Net-Libraries. For information on disabling or enabling server Net-Libraries, see the topic "SQL Server Network Utility" in SQL Server 2000 Books Online.</P>

<P>The use of UDP port 1434 by a computer will not stop until all instances of SQL Server 2000 and MSDE 2000 on the computer have been upgraded to SP3a and configured to not support network communications.</P>

<P>Whether UDP port 1434 is open or closed does not depend on the state of the shared memory Net-Library. The shared memory Net-Library is used only for local connections, and does not use a network. The shared memory Net-Library is always active; it cannot be enabled or disabled.</P>

<P>You can also specify whether the server Net-Libraries are disabled when installing or upgrading an instance of MSDE 2000. Use either the MSDE 2000 Setup utility <B>DISABLENETWORKPROTOCOLS</B> parameter, or the MSDE 2000 merge module <B>SqlDisableNetworkProtocols</B> property. For more information on these options, see <A HREF="#_3467463_msde_2000_setup_parameters_wluf">3.7.3 MSDE 2000 Setup Parameters</A></P>

<P>You cannot disable all of the server Net-Libraries when installing or upgrading instances of the SQL Server 2000 database engine.</P>

<H3><A NAME="_new_pivot_table_service_restricted_clien_cuy1"></A>5.2.7 New PivotTable Service Restricted Client Property</H3>

<P><I>Introduced in SP3</I></P>

<P>SP3 introduced a new PivotTable Service connection string property, <B>Restricted Client</B>. This property can be used to restrict PivotTable Service from using local cube functionality. Any attempt to use a statement that involves the creation or use of a local cube, such as the CREATE CUBE, CREATE GLOBAL CUBE, and CREATE SESSION CUBE statements, raises an error. Additionally, any statement that involves deep recursion, such as a series of nested DRILLDOWN statements, raises an error if the statement can potentially overflow the statement stack maintained by PivotTable Service. </P>

<P>This property stores a string value. If the value is set to any string value starting with the characters "Y", "y", "T", or "t", or any string value that can be converted to a numeric value other than 0, PivotTable Service is restricted as described earlier. If the value is set to any other string value, including an empty string (""), or any string value that can be converted to a numeric value equal to 0, PivotTable Service is unrestricted. The default value for this property is "0".</P>

However, if this format is required for business reasons, you can enable the option through the <B>EnableMigrationToMetaDataServicesFormat</B> registry key. </P>

<P>By default, this registry key does not exist; it must be manually created at <B>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\OLAP Server\Server Connection Info</B> and set to enable repository migration to the Meta Data Services format. This registry key stores a case-sensitive string value. If the value is set to <B>1</B> or <B>True</B>, repository migration to the Meta Data Services format is enabled. If the value is set to any other string value, or if the registry key does not exist, repository migration to the Meta Data Services format is disabled. </P>

<H3><A NAME="_permissions_must_be_modified_on_a_remote_d3jb"></A>5.2.10 Permissions Must be Modified on a Remote Data Folder</H3>

<P><I>Introduced in SP3</I></P>

<P>If the Analysis Services Data folder is located on a computer other than the one on which the Analysis server is running, you must modify the permissions on the folder after running SP3a Setup. On the remote computer, set the permissions on the folder to allow full control access by all members of the <B>OLAP Administrators</B> group on the computer running the Analysis server. Over time, as members are added to or removed from the <B>OLAP Administrators</B> group, be sure to modify the permissions on the remote Data folder to so that it reflects the current membership of the <B>OLAP Administrators</B> group. This will allow backup and restore to function properly.</P>

<P>Additionally, after running SP3a Setup, you must allow the account under which the Analysis server is running full control access to the remote Data folder. </P>

<P>If you apply SP3a to an instance of Analysis Services running in a clustered configuration, the domain-level <B>OLAP Administrators</B> group must be allowed full control access to the remote Data folder.

<H2><A NAME="_replication_enhancements"></A>5.3 Replication Enhancements</H2>

<P>This section discusses enhancements to SQL Server 2000 replication that are included with SP3a.</P>

<H3><A NAME="_transactional_replication_update_custom_stored_procedure"></A>5.3.1 Transactional Replication UPDATE Custom Stored Procedure</H3>

<P><I>Introduced in SP1</I></P>

<P>During transactional replication setup, custom stored procedures for insert, delete, and update actions are created in the subscription database. Regardless of how many columns are affected by an UPDATE statement, the update custom stored procedure updates all of the columns in the subscription table. Any column that has not changed is reset to the same values that existed before the update. Typically, this action causes no problems. However, if any of these columns are indexed, this resetting can become expensive.</P>

<P>If you use transactional replication and have several indexes on the subscription table, and only a few column values change because of updates, the overhead of maintaining the index can limit performance when changes are applied at the Subscriber. For example, a subscription database that is used for reporting purposes may have many more indexes than the publication database. Dynamically building the UPDATE statement at run time can improve performance. The update includes only the columns that have changed, creating an optimal UPDATE string. </P>

<P>This service pack includes a new stored procedure, <B>sp_scriptdynamicupdproc</B>, which generates a custom stored procedure that you can use at the Subscriber to dynamically build the UPDATE statement at run time. However, building the dynamic UPDATE statement at run time requires extra processing.</P>

<H4>sp_scriptdynamicupdproc</H4>

<P>The stored procedure <B>sp_scriptdynamicupdproc</B> generates the CREATE PROCEDURE statement that creates a dynamic update stored procedure. The UPDATE statement within the custom stored procedure is built dynamically, based on the MCALL syntax that indicates which columns to change. Use this stored procedure if the number of indexes on the subscribing table is growing and the number of columns being changed is small. This stored procedure is run at the Publisher on the publication database.</P>

<H5>Syntax</H5>

<P>sp_scriptdynamicupdproc [ <B>@artid</B> =] <I>artid</I></P>

<H5>Arguments</H5>

<P>[<B>@artid</B> <B>=</B>] <I>artid</I></P>

<P>The article ID. <I>artid</I> is an <B>int</B>, with no default.</P>

<H5>Result Sets</H5>

<P>Returns a result set that consists of a single <B>nvarchar(4000)</B> column. The result set forms the complete CREATE PROCEDURE statement that is used to create the custom stored procedure.</P>

<H5>Remarks</H5>

<P><B>sp_scriptdynamicupdproc</B> is used in transactional replication. The default MCALL scripting logic includes all columns within the UPDATE statement and uses a bitmap to determine the columns that have changed. If a column did not change, the column is set back to itself, which usually causes no problems. If the column is indexed, extra processing occurs. By contrast, this stored procedure uses a dynamic approach: it includes only the columns that have changed, which provides an optimal UPDATE string. However, extra processing is incurred at run time when the dynamic UPDATE statement is built. It is recommended that you test both the dynamic stored procedure approach and the static default approach, and then choose the optimal solution for your particular needs.</P>

<H5>Permissions</H5>

<P>Members of the <B>public</B> role can execute <B>sp_scriptdynamicupdproc</B>.</P>

<H5>Examples</H5>

<P>This example creates an article (with <I>artid</I> set to <B>1</B>) on the <B>authors</B> table in the <B>pubs</B> database, and specifies that the UPDATE statement is the custom stored procedure to execute:</P>

<H3><A NAME="_transactional_replication_update_statements_on_unique_columns"></A>5.3.2 Transactional Replication UPDATE Statements on Unique Columns</H3>

<P><I>Introduced in SP1</I></P>

<P>In transactional replication, UPDATE statements usually are replicated as updates. But if the update changes any column that is part of a unique index, a clustered index, or an expression that is used as a unique constraint, the update is performed as a DELETE statement followed by an INSERT statement at the Subscriber. This is done because this type of update can affect multiple rows and a uniqueness violation can occur if updates are delivered row by row. </P>

<P>If the update affects only one row, there is no chance for a uniqueness violation. Therefore, trace flag 8207 has been added to this service pack to allow updates to any unique column that affect only one row to be replicated as UPDATE statements. This optimization has been added specifically for applications that install user-defined UPDATE triggers at the Subscriber and require these triggers to fire for updates that affect only one row on a unique column.</P>

<P>To use trace flag 8207, turn it on from the command prompt (sqlservr.exe -<B>T8207</B>) or at run time using DBCC TRACEON(8207, -1) before the Log Reader Agent is started.</P>

<P class=indent><!--IMPORTANT--><P ID="Alert_Important"><B CLASS="notes">Important</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Typically, trace flag 8207 is used with read-only transactional replication. Do not use this trace flag with updatable subscriptions if the primary key UPDATE can occur at the Subscriber. </P><!--/IMPORTANT--></P>

<H3><A NAME="_restrictions_removed_from_concurrent_snapshot_processing"></A>5.3.3 Restrictions Removed from Concurrent Snapshot Processing</H3>

<P><I>Introduced in SP1</I></P>

<P>In SQL Server 2000, concurrent snapshot processing was not recommended if the publishing table had a unique index that was not the primary key or the clustering key. If data modifications were made to the clustering key while a concurrent snapshot was being generated, replication could fail with a duplicate key error when applying the concurrent snapshot to a Subscriber. With this service pack, restrictions on using concurrent snapshot processing are removed.</P>

<H3><A NAME="_transactional_replication_scripting_custom_stored_procedures"></A>5.3.4 Transactional Replication Scripting Custom Stored Procedures</H3>

<P><I>Introduced in SP1</I></P>

<P>When setting up nosync subscriptions (that is, subscriptions that do not receive the initial snapshot), the custom stored procedures for INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements must be created manually. Typically, these statements are created at the Subscriber when the initial snapshot is delivered. A new stored procedure, <B>sp_scriptpublicationcustomprocs</B>, has been added to generate scripts for the custom stored procedures at the publication level. This new functionality may make it easier to set up nosync subscriptions.</P>

<H4>sp_scriptpublicationcustomprocs</H4>

<P>In a publication in which the option to auto-generate a custom procedure schema is enabled, the stored procedure <B>sp_scriptpublicationcustomprocs</B> scripts the custom INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE procedures for all table articles. <B>sp_scriptpublicationcustomprocs</B> is particularly useful for setting up subscriptions for which the snapshot is applied manually.</P>

<H5>Syntax</H5>

<P><B>sp_scriptpublicationcustomprocs</B> [<B>@publication</B>]= <I>publication_name</I></P>

<H5>Arguments</H5>

<P class=dt>[<B>@publication</B>]<CODE> = </CODE><I>publication_name</I></P>

<P class=indent>The name of the publication. <I>publication_name</I> is a <B>sysname</B> with no default.</P>

<H5>Return Code Values</H5>

<P>0 (success) or 1 (failure)</P>

<H5>Result Sets</H5>

<P>Returns a result set that consists of a single <B>nvarchar(4000)</B> column. The result set forms the complete CREATE PROCEDURE statement that is necessary to create the custom stored procedure.</P>

<H5>Remarks</H5>

<P>Custom procedures are not scripted for articles without the auto-generate custom procedure (0x2) schema option.</P>

<H5>Permissions</H5>

<P>Execute permission is granted to <B>public</B>; a procedural security check is performed inside this stored procedure to restrict access to members of the <B>sysadmin</B> fixed server role and <B>db_owner</B> fixed database role in current database.</P>

<H5>Example</H5>

<P>This example generates a script of the custom stored procedures in a publication named <B>Northwind</B>.</P>

<H3><A NAME="_merge_replication_retention-based_meta_data_clean_up"></A>5.3.5 Merge Replication Retention-Based Meta Data Clean Up</H3>

<P><I>Introduced in SP1</I></P>

<P>When merge replication system tables contain large amounts of meta data, cleaning up the meta data improves performance. Prior to SQL Server 2000 SP1, meta data could be cleaned up only by running <B>sp_mergecleanupmetadata</B>. However, SQL Server 2000 SP1 and later versions include retention-based meta data clean up, which means that meta data can be automatically deleted from the following system tables: 

<UL type=disc>
	<LI><B>MSmerge_contents</B><BR><BR></LI>

	<LI><B>MSmerge_tombstone</B><BR><BR></LI>

	<LI><B>MSmerge_genhistory</B><BR><BR></LI>

	<LI>Any before image tables, if present</LI>
</UL>

<P class=indent><!--NOTE--><P ID="Alert_Note"><B>Note</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Before image<I> </I>tables are present if the <B>@keep_partition_changes</B> synchronization optimization option is enabled on the publication.</P><!--/NOTE--></P>

<P>Retention-based meta data clean up occurs as follows:

<UL type=disc>
	<LI>If the <B>&#0150;MetadataRetentionCleanup</B> Merge Agent parameter is set to 1, as it is by default, the Merge Agent cleans up the Subscriber and the Publisher that are involved in the merge. <BR><BR></LI>

	<LI>If the <B>-MetadataRetentionCleanup</B> parameter is set to 0, automatic clean up does not occur. In this case, manually initiate retention-based meta data clean up by executing <B>sp_mergemetadataretentioncleanup</B>. This stored procedure must be executed at every Publisher and Subscriber that should be cleaned up. It is recommended, but not required, that the Publisher and Subscribers be cleaned up at similar points in time (see <A HREF="#_preventing_false_conflicts">Preventing False Conflicts</A> later in this section).
<P class=atl><!--NOTE--><P ID="Alert_Note"><B>Note</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The <B>-MetadataRetentionCleanup</B> parameter is set to <B>1</B> for all Merge Agent profiles that are included with SQL Server 2000 SP1 and later versions. If you upgrade a server to SP1 or later and then add merge replication, the Merge Agent profile is automatically updated to include this parameter. If you upgrade a server that already has merge replication enabled to SP1 or later, the Merge Agent profile is not automatically updated; update the profile by running <B>sp_add_agent_parameter</B> (see <A HREF="#_additional_parameter_for_sp_add_agent_parameter">Additional Parameter for sp_add_agent_parameter</A> later in this section).</P><!--/NOTE--></p>
<P class=atl><!--IMPORTANT--><P ID="Alert_Important"><B CLASS="notes">Important</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The default retention period for publications is 14 days. If an article belongs to several publications, there might be different retention periods. In that situation, the longest retention period is used to determine the earliest possible time that clean up can occur. If there are multiple publications on a database, and if any one of those publications uses an infinite publication retention period (<B>@retention=0</B>), merge meta data for the database is not automatically cleaned up. For this reason, use infinite publication retention with caution.</P><!--/IMPORTANT--></p></LI>

<H4><A NAME="_additional_parameter_for_sp_add_agent_parameter"></A>Additional Parameter for sp_add_agent_parameter</H4>

<P>The system stored procedure <B>sp_add_agent_parameter</B> now has a <B>MetadataRetentionCleanup</B> parameter, which allows you to add or remove meta data retention clean up from Merge Agent profiles. A value of 1 indicates that the profile should include clean up; a value of 0 indicates that it should not include clean up. For example, to add meta data retention clean up to a profile, execute the following code:</P>

<PRE><CODE>EXEC sp_add_agent_parameter @profile_id=&lt;my_profile_id&gt;,
  @parameter_name='MetadataRetentionCleanup', @parameter_value=1</CODE></PRE>

<H4>Meta Data Cleanup in Topologies with Different Versions of SQL Server</H4>

<P>For automatic retention-based clean up to occur in a database involved in merge replication, the database and the Merge Agent must both be on servers running SQL Server 2000 SP1 or later. For example:

<UL type=disc>
	<LI>A SQL Server 7.0 pull Subscriber does not run clean up at a SQL Server 2000 SP1 Publisher.<BR><BR></LI>

	<LI>A SQL Server 2000 SP1 push Merge Agent does not run clean up in a pre-SP1 SQL Server 2000 Subscriber database. <BR><BR></LI>

	<LI>A SQL Server 2000 SP1 push Merge Agent runs clean up in a SQL Server 2000 SP1 Publisher database, even if it has subscribers that are running SQL Server 2000 or earlier.</LI>
</UL>

<P>Automatic clean up on some servers and not on others will at most cause false conflicts, and those should be rare. For topologies that include versions of SQL Server prior to SQL Server 2000 SP1, you may see performance benefits by running <B>sp_mergemetadatacleanup</B> on all servers that are not cleaned up automatically.</P>

<H4><A NAME="_preventing_false_conflicts"></A>Preventing False Conflicts</H4>

<P>Retention-based meta data clean up prevents non-convergence and silent overwrites of changes at other nodes. However, false conflicts can occur if the following conditions are met:

<UL type=disc>
	<LI>The meta data is cleaned up at one node and not another.<BR><BR></LI>

	<LI>A subsequent update at the cleaned-up node occurs on a row whose meta data was deleted.</LI>
</UL>

<P>For example, if meta data is cleaned up at the Publisher but not at the Subscriber, and an update is made at the Publisher, a conflict occurs even though the data appears to be synchronized. </P>

<P>To prevent this conflict, make sure that meta data is cleaned up at related nodes at about the same time. If <B>-MetadataRetentionCleanup</B> is set to 1, both the Publisher and Subscriber are cleaned up automatically before the merge starts, thereby ensuring that the nodes are cleaned up at the same time. If a conflict occurs, use the merge replication conflict viewer to review the conflict and change the outcome if necessary.</P>

<P>If an article belongs to several publications or is in a republishing scenario, it is possible that the retention periods for a given row at the Publisher and Subscriber are different. To reduce the chance of cleaning up meta data on one side but not the other, it is recommended that those different publications have similar retention periods.</P>

<P class=indent><!--NOTE--><P ID="Alert_Note"><B>Note</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;If the system tables contain large amounts of meta data that must be cleaned up, the merge process may take longer to run. Clean up the meta data on a regular basis to prevent this issue.</P><!--/NOTE--></P>

<H3><A NAME="_backup_and_restore_issues_for_merge_replication"></A>5.3.6 Backup and Restore Issues for Merge Replication</H3>

<P><I>Introduced in SP1</I></P>

<P>A publication database that is restored from a backup should first synchronize with a subscription database that has a global subscription (that is, a subscription having an assigned priority value) to guarantee correct convergence behavior. Synchronization ensures that the changes that were lost at the publication database because of the restore operation are reapplied accurately.</P>

<P>Do not synchronize the publication database with a subscription database that has an anonymous subscription. Because anonymous subscriptions do not have enough meta data to apply changes to the publication database, such synchronization can lead to the non-convergence of data. </P>

<P>When you are planning back up and restore operations for merge replication, consider the following additional issues: 

<UL type=disc>
	<LI>Restore the subscription databases from backups that are not beyond the retention period.</LI>
</UL>

<P class=indent>Restore a subscription database from a backup only if the backup is no older than the shortest retention period of all publications to which the Subscriber subscribes. For example, if a Subscriber subscribes to three publications with retention periods of 10, 20, and 30 days, respectively, the backup used to restore the database should not be more than 10 days old. 

<UL type=disc>
	<LI>Synchronize before generating a backup.</LI>
</UL>

<P class=indent>It is strongly recommended that a Subscriber synchronize with the Publisher before you perform a backup. Otherwise, the system might not converge correctly if the Subscriber is restored from this backup. Although the backup file itself might be new, the last synchronization with a Publisher could be almost as old as the retention period. For example, consider a publication with a retention period of 10 days. The last synchronization was 8 days ago, and now the backup is performed. If the backup is applied 4 days later, the last synchronization will have occurred 12 days ago, which is past the retention period. If the Subscriber had synchronized right before the backup, the subscription database would be within the retention period.

<UL type=disc>
	<LI>Reinitialize the Subscriber if you change the publication retention value.</LI>
</UL>

<P class=indent>If you need to change the publication retention value, manually reinitialize the Subscriber to avoid the non-convergence of data. The retention-based meta data clean up feature deletes outdated meta data from merge system tables when the publication retention period is reached. </P>

<P class=indent>The publication retention value is used to determine when subscriptions that have not synchronized within the retention period should expire. If, after a clean up, the publication retention period is increased and a subscription attempts to merge with the Publisher (which has already deleted the meta data), the subscription will not expire because of the increased retention value. Furthermore, the Publisher does not have enough meta data to download changes to the Subscriber, which leads to non-convergence.

<UL type=disc>
	<LI>Use the same publication retention values for all Publishers and their alternate synchronization partners. Using different values can lead to non-convergence.</LI>
</UL>

<H3><A NAME="_restoring_replicated_databases_from_different_versions_of_sql_server"></A>5.3.7 Restoring Replicated Databases from Different Versions of SQL Server</H3>

<P><I>Introduced in SP1</I></P>

<P>Restoring a backup to the same server and database&#0151;running the same version as the server from which the backup was created&#0151;preserves your replication settings. If you are restoring a replicated database to a version of SQL Server that is different from the version used to back up the database, consider the following issues:

<UL type=disc>
	<LI>If you are restoring the database to SQL Server 2000 SP3a from a backup created with SQL Server 2000 and you want to preserve replication settings, you must run <B>sp_vupgrade_replication</B>. Running <B>sp_vupgrade_replication</B> ensures that the replication meta data is upgraded. If you do not run <B>sp_vupgrade_replication</B>, the replication meta data can be left in an unpredictable state.<BR><BR></LI>

	<LI>If you are restoring the database to SQL Server 2000 from a backup created with SQL Server 7.0 (the release version, SP1, SP2, SP3, and SP4) and you want to preserve replication settings, you must re-create the backup before installing service packs. It is possible to restore the database to SQL Server 2000 SP3a directly from a backup of a replicated database created in SQL Server 7.0, but replication settings are not maintained.</LI>
</UL>

<H3><A NAME="_a_new_-maxcmdsintran_parameter_for_log_reader_agent"></A>5.3.8 New -MaxCmdsInTran Parameter for Log Reader Agent</H3>

<P><I>Introduced in SP1</I></P>

<P>Starting with SP1, a new command prompt parameter, <B>-MaxCmdsInTran</B>, has been added for the Log Reader Agent. For transactions affecting a large number of commands (typically mass updates or deletes), the Distribution Agent must wait for the Log Reader Agent to write the entire transaction to the distribution database before it can start propagating the transaction to the Subscriber. This delay blocks the Distribution Agent and reduces the parallelism between the two agents.</P>

<P>By using <B>&#0150;MaxCmdsInTran</B>, the Log Reader Agent breaks large transactions into smaller chunks, and each chunk contains the same or fewer commands as the <B>-MaxCmdsInTran</B> input. Therefore, the Distribution Agent can start processing earlier chunks of a transaction while the Log Reader Agent is still working through later chunks of the same transaction.</P>

<P>This improvement in parallelism between the Log Reader Agent and the Distribution Agent contributes to better overall replication throughput. Note, however, that the transaction chunks are committed at the Subscriber as individual transactions, which breaks the property of atomicity, one of the ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability) properties. This outcome is not a problem in most circumstances, though it is recommended that you test this to make sure.</P>

<H5>Defining the &#0150;MaxCmdsInTran Parameter</H5>

<P>Specify a positive integer (1 or above) for the <B>-MaxCmdsInTran</B> parameter value. Specifying a value of 0 is equivalent to not using the parameter. Because this parameter improves performance only when the transaction is very large, a value of 5000 or greater for this parameter is typical. For example:</P>

<PRE><CODE>logread.exe -MaxCmdsInTran 10000. </CODE></PRE>

<P>To use this parameter, the Publisher must be running SQL Server 2000 SP1 or a later version, and the Log Reader Agent and distribution database must be upgraded to SP3 or later. Otherwise, <B>-MaxCmdsInTran</B> is ignored.</P>

<H3><A NAME="_a_new_-maxnetworkoptimization_command_line_argument_for_snapshot_agent"></A>5.3.10 New -MaxNetworkOptimization Command Line Argument for Snapshot Agent</H3>

<P><I>Introduced in SP2.</I></P>

<P>During normal processing, merge replication can send DELETE commands to Subscribers for rows that do not belong to the Subscriber's partition. DELETE commands of this type are referred to as irrelevant deletes. Irrelevant deletes do not affect data integrity or convergence, but they can result in unnecessary network traffic. </P>

<P>To reduce network traffic caused by irrelevant deletes, you can use the new Snapshot Agent parameter <BR>
<B>-MaxNetworkOptimization</B> with merge replication publications. Setting the parameter to 1 minimizes the chances of irrelevant deletes, which maximizes network optimization. </P>

<P class=indent><!--NOTE--><P ID="Alert_Note"><B>Note</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Setting this parameter to 1 is useful only when the synchronization optimization option of the merge publication is set to true (the <B>@keep_partition_changes</B> parameter of <B>sp_addmergepublication</B>).</P><!--/NOTE--></P>

<P>The default is 0 because setting the parameter to 1 can increase the storage of meta data and cause performance to degrade at the Publisher if multiple levels of join filters and complex subset filters are present. You should carefully assess your replication topology and set <B>-MaxNetworkOptimization</B> to 1 only if network traffic from irrelevant deletes is unacceptably high.</P>

<P>You can add this parameter to the Snapshot Agent profile by executing the system procedure <B>sp_add_agent_parameter</B> as follows:</P>

<P>Multiserver administration is the process of automating administration tasks across multiple instances of SQL Server. Use multiserver administration if you manage two or more servers and you want to centralize maintenance tasks.</P>

<P>In SP3a, the SQL Server Agent service account does not have to be a Windows administrator unless you need to use the SQL Server Agent Proxy Account. For more information about the SQL Server Agent Proxy Account, see Section 5.7.3 <A HREF="#_sql_server_agent_proxy_account_improvements">SQL Server Agent Proxy Account Improvements</A>.

<P>With multiserver administration, you must have at least one master server and at least one target server. A master server distributes jobs to and receives events from target servers. A master server stores the central copy of job definitions for jobs that run on target servers. Target servers connect periodically to their master server to update their list of jobs to perform. If a new job exists, the target server downloads the job and disconnects from the master server. After the target server completes the job, it reconnects to the master server and reports the status of the job.</P>

<H3><A NAME="_sql_server_agent_permission_checks_d3jb"></A>5.4.4 SQL Server Agent Permission Checks</H3>

<P><I>Introduced in SP3</I></P>

<P>SQL Server now checks to ensure that the Agent job owner has permission to append or overwrite the output log file from each job. This happens in three ways:

<UL type=disc>
	<LI>If the job owner is a member of the <B>sysadmin</B> fixed server role, the job output log file can be written to the server. <BR><BR></LI>

	<LI>If the job owner is a Windows user, SQL Server tests to see if the user has permission to write to the selected job output log file location on the server.<BR><BR></LI>

	<LI>If the job owner is a SQL Server user, SQL Server tests the SQL Server Agent proxy account for permission to write to the selected job output log file location on the server. If the proxy account has not been set, no log is written. </LI>
</UL>

<P>In all cases, jobs are written with SQL Server Agent credentials, but SQL Server now tests to ensure the user has permission to write to the selected job output log file location on the server. Errors appear in the job history, but the job steps do not fail if the log file cannot be written.</P>

<H3><A NAME="_5464465_sql_server_agent_mail_mapi_profi_d3jb"></A>5.4.5 SQL Agent Mail MAPI Profiles</H3>

<P><I>Introduced in SP3</I></P>

<P>In the 32-bit version of SQL Server 2000, SQL Agent Mail can be configured to use an Extended MAPI e-mail profile for sending e-mail alerts. You can use an Extended MAPI e-mail application, such as Microsoft Outlook, to create an Extended MAPI profile. In the 64-bit version of SQL Server 2000, SQL Agent Mail can only use a Simple MAPI profile for sending e-mail alerts. Do not use Simple MAPI profiles in the 32-bit version of SQL Server 2000.</P>

<H2><A NAME="_sql_server_connectivity_components_aks2"></A>5.5 SQL Server Connectivity Components Enhancements</H2>

<P>This section discusses enhancements to connectivity components of SQL Sever 2000 that are included with SP3a.</P>

<H3><A NAME="_microsoft_data_access_components_9s7l"></A>5.5.1 Updates to Microsoft Data Access Components</H3>

<P><I>Introduced in SP3a</I></P>

<P>SP3a includes updates to the Microsoft Data Access Components (MDAC). When you install SP3a, MDAC 2.7 Service Pack 1a is also installed. MDAC 2.7 SP1a has no feature changes from the version of MDAC installed by SQL Server 2000 (MDAC 2.6), but it does include fixes and security enhancements. MDAC 2.7 SP1a includes an upgrade to MSXML 3 SP3.</P>

<P><!--NOTE--><P ID="Alert_Note"><B>Note</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;This version of MDAC is not installed if Setup detects the same version or a newer version.</P><!--/NOTE--></P>

<P>For more information about this version of MDAC, see the Microsoft Universal Data Access Web site at this page on <A HREF="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=9371" target=_blank>microsoft.com</A>. Fixes included in this version of MDAC will be documented in Knowledge Base article <A HREF="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=11610" target=_blank>326848</A>. You can access this article from the <A HREF="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=3930" target=_blank>Microsoft Product Support Services Knowledge Base</A>.</P>

<H3><A NAME="_support_for_qlogic_virtual_interface_arc_wrr2"></A>5.5.2 Support for QLogic Virtual Interface Architecture</H3>

<P><I>Introduced in SP3</I></P>

<P>SQL Server now supports QLogic Virtual Interface Architecture (VIA) System Area Network (SAN) implementations. To enable SQL Server support for connections over QLogic VIA, both the client and server computers must provide IP address resolution in a file named Vihosts in the appropriate Windows system32\drivers\etc folder.</P>

<P>The Vihosts file should be formatted as follows:</P>

<P>&lt;VI IP Address of server computer&gt; &lt;SERVER_COMPUTERNAME&gt;</P>

<P>&lt;VI IP Address of client computer&gt; &lt;CLIENT_COMPUTERNAME&gt;</P>

<P>For example:</P>

<P>139.4.130.1&nbsp; SQLCOMPUTER</P>

<P>139.4.130.2&nbsp; SQLCLIENT</P>

<P>Use IP addresses from the respective QLogic VIA network cards and actual computer names. Otherwise, connections cannot be made to named instances or with other IP protocols such as TCP or Named Pipes. The Vihosts file is not necessary for Giganet VIA connectivity. </P>

<P class=indent><!--NOTE--><P ID="Alert_Note"><B>Note</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;You must identify the correct VIA vendor on client computers by using Client Network Utility. Select the appropriate value in the <B>Vendor</B> drop-down box. The corresponding action should also be completed on server computers through Server Network Utility.</P><!--/NOTE--></P>

<H2><A NAME="_meta_data_services"></A>5.6 Meta Data Services Enhancements</H2>

<P>This section discusses enhancements to SQL Server 2000 Meta Data Services that are included with SP3a.</P>

<H3><A NAME="_meta_data_browser_exports_in_unicode"></A>5.6.1 Meta Data Browser Exports in Unicode</H3>

<P><I>Introduced in SP1</I></P>

<P>Meta Data Browser now exports XML-based meta data in Unicode. Before SQL Server 2000 SP1, the browser exported ANSI code, which does not support non-English characters. This functional change is invisible to the user. As of this SP3a release, exported data is always expressed as Unicode. You can still export in ANSI code by setting the value of the registry key <B>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Repository\Engine\XMLExport</B> to 0. The following list represents the values that you can set for this registry key:

<UL type=disc>
	<LI>NOOBJID=1<BR><BR></LI>

	<LI>NOHEADER=2<BR><BR></LI>

	<LI>INDENTATION=4<BR><BR></LI>

	<LI>UNICODE=8<BR><BR></LI>

	<LI>LOGUNMAPPEDTAGS=16<BR><BR></LI>

	<LI>EXPORTBASE=32</LI>
</UL>

<P>For more information about each flag, see "IExport::Export Method" in SQL Server Books Online.</P>

<H3><A NAME="_scripting_support_disabled_fzpy"></A>5.6.2 Scripting Support Disabled</H3>

<P><I>Introduced in SP3</I></P>

<P>Script support in information models has been disabled. After installing SP3a, you receive the following error if your application accesses a property or method for which a script is defined: </P>

<PRE><CODE>EREP_SCRIPTS_NOTENABLED</CODE></PRE>

<P class=label><B>To enable script support</B></P>

<P>If you need to continue executing scripts, you can use the following procedure to create a registry setting that enables script support. 

<OL>
	<LI>Open Registry Editor and navigate to <B>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft</B>. <BR><BR></LI>

	<LI>Create a registry key named <B>Repository</B> (if one does not already exist), and then create a sub-key named <B>Engine</B> so that the path equals <B>Repository\Engine</B>. <BR><BR></LI>

	<LI>On the <B>Engine</B> registry key, add a new DWORD value named <B>AllowScripting</B> and set the value to <B>1</B>. </LI>
</OL>

<P>If you want to disable scripting later, set the value of this new registry key to <B>0</B>.</P>

<P class=indent><!--IMPORTANT--><P ID="Alert_Important"><B CLASS="notes">Important</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;You should always secure information models and the repository database to prevent unauthorized access.</P><!--/IMPORTANT--></P>

<H3><A NAME="_new_repositoryuser_role_needed_to_access_d3jb"></A>5.6.3 New RepositoryUser Role for Accessing Repository Information</H3>

<P><I>Introduced in SP3</I></P>

<P>SQL Server includes in the <B>msdb</B> database a set of tables, stored procedures, and views that store information used by the Meta Data Services repository engine. In SP3, a new dedicated role named <B>RepositoryUser</B> was added and must be used to access and update repository information. This role has been granted create, read, update, delete, and execute permissions on these objects. The <B>public</B> role no longer has permissions on these objects. </P>

<P>This change affects existing repository objects in addition to any additional objects created by the repository engine in the future. Users and applications that access the repository through the <B>public</B> role must be added to the <B>RepositoryUser </B>role.</P>

<H2><A NAME="_data_transformation_services"></A>5.7 Data Transformation Services Enhancements</H2>

<P>This section discusses enhancements to SQL Server 2000 Data Transformation Services that are included with SP3a.</P>

<H3><A NAME="_dts_wizard_no_longer_limits_string_columns_to_255_characters"></A>5.7.1 DTS Wizard No Longer Limits String Columns to 255 Characters</H3>

<P><I>Introduced in SP2</I></P>

<P>When you export data to a text file, the DTS Import/Export Wizard now configures the package to write up to 8000 characters of any column containing string-type data.</P>

<H3><A NAME="_security_context_logged_for_dts_packages_run_by_sql_server_agent"></A>5.7.2 Security Context Logged for DTS Packages Run by SQL Server Agent</H3>

<P><I>Introduced in SP2</I></P>

<P>SQL Server Agent records the security context under which each step in a job runs. In SP3 or later, the security context appears in the Job History dialog box. When you run a DTS package from a step in a job, the SQL Server Agent logs the user account under which the package runs. This information helps administrators diagnose permission and authentication issues that occur when DTS packages are scheduled to run on a server.</P>

<H3><A NAME="_sql_server_agent_proxy_account_improvements"></A>5.7.3 SQL Server Agent Proxy Account Improvements</H3>

<P><I>Introduced in SP2</I></P>

<P>Prior to SP2, DTS packages stored on the server could not be run under the credentials of the SQL Server Agent Proxy Account unless the proxy account had access to the user Temp folder for the account under which either the server (in the case of jobs run from <B>xp_cmdshell</B>), or the agent (in the case of agent jobs) was running. Because of this, users often had to adjust the TEMP environment variable for the SQL Server or SQL Agent startup account to point to a directory that was accessible to both the startup and the proxy accounts, such as C:\Temp. For SP2 and later, DTS has been enhanced to use the system Temp folder if the user Temp folder is unavailable, greatly reducing the need for these adjustments.</P>

<H3><A NAME="_save_to_repository_disabled_by_default_d3jb"></A>5.7.4 Save to Meta Data Services Disabled by Default</H3>

<P><I>Introduced in SP3</I></P>

<P>By default, SP3 and later disables the option to store DTS packages in Meta Data Services. This means that the <B>Meta Data Services</B> option does not appear in the <B>Location</B> drop-down list in the <B>Save DTS Packages</B> dialog box. In addition, this option is disabled on the Save, schedule, and replicate package page in the DTS Import/Export Wizard. </P>

<P class=label><B>To allow packages to be saved in Meta Data Services</B>

<UL type=disc>
	<LI>In SQL Server Enterprise Manager, right-click the <B>Data Transformation Services</B> node, click <B>Properties</B>, and then click <B>Enable Save to Meta Data Services</B>. 
<P class=atl><!--NOTE--><P ID="Alert_Note"><B>Note</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;You must be logged on with administrator privileges to modify this property.</P><!--/NOTE--></p></LI>
</UL>

<P>When the option to store packages in Meta Data Service is disabled, you can load existing packages from Meta Data Services, edit them, and save them to Meta Data Services using the <B>Save</B> option. However, Meta Data Services is not available from the <B>Save As</B> option. For example, you cannot re-save a package to Meta Data Services using a different name.</P>

<H2><A NAME="_sqlxml_enhancement_d3jb"></A>5.8 XML Enhancements</H2>

<P>The following topic discusses an enhancement for XML and SQLXML in SP3a.</P>

<H3><A NAME="_improved_validation_of_xpath_expressions_wluf"></A>5.8.1 Improved Validation of XPath Expressions</H3>

<P><I>Introduced in SP3</I></P>

<P>Prior to SP3, the version of MSXML that was installed with SQL Server 2000 (MSXML 2.6) permitted a predicate in an XPath expression to follow the special character abbreviation that identifies the current context node, which is denoted by a period (<CODE>.</CODE>) in XPath syntax. This violates the XPath syntax specification, which requires that this character be followed by a location path expression. </P>

<P>When you apply SP3 or later, an updated version of MSXML (3.0 SP3) is installed as part of the MDAC upgrade. For more information, see Section 5.5.1 <A HREF="#_microsoft_data_access_components_9s7l">Updates to Microsoft Data Access Components</A>. </P>

<P>With the new version of MSXML, a predicate cannot immediately follow the current context node abbreviation special character. XPath expressions in SQLXML queries (XPath queries against annotated mapping schemas and in XSLT style sheets written to transform the results of SQLXML queries) that use the faulty syntax will fail after you upgrade to SP3 or later.</P>

<P>To prevent these failures, identify and fix any expressions that use the incorrect syntax. For example, the syntax of the XPath expression that is specified as the value of the test attribute in the following <CODE>xsl:if</CODE> element is not valid because the predicate, <CODE>[@ResourceTypeID='2']</CODE>, immediately follows the special character abbreviation that identifies the current context node. </P>

<P>The following statement, which previously did not generate an error, will fail after SP3 or later is installed. </P>

<PRE><CODE>&lt;xsl:if test=".[@ResourceTypeID='2']"&gt;</CODE></PRE>

<P>To prevent a failure, the XPath expression must be amended as follows:</P>

<PRE><CODE>&lt;xsl:if test="@ResourceTypeID='2'"&gt;</CODE></PRE>

<H2><A NAME="_enhancements_to_the_virtual_backup_device_api"></A>5.9 Virtual Backup Device API Enhancements</H2>

<P>The following item applies to the SQL Server 2000 Virtual Backup Device API.</P>

<H3><A NAME="_capturing_multiple_databases_in_a_single_snapshot"></A>5.9.1 Capturing Multiple Databases in a Single Snapshot</H3>

<P><I>Introduced in SP2</I></P>

<P>The Virtual Backup Device API allows ISVs to integrate SQL Server 2000 into their products. This API is engineered to provide maximum reliability and performance. It fully supports the backup and restore functionality of SQL Server 2000, including the complete range of hot and snapshot backup capabilities.</P>

<P>In SP1 and earlier, there was no way to freeze and back up more than a single database at one time. SP3 or later now provides server-side support for freezing and capturing multiple databases in a single snapshot through the <B>VDC_PrepareToFreeze</B> command.</P>

<P>The Virtual Backup Device Specification in SP3a contains updated information about the <B>VDC_PrepareTo Freeze</B> command. An updated version of the Virtual Device Interface header file (Vdi.h) can be found at \Devtools\Include in the SP3a setup directory. </P>

<P>You can download the updated specification from the Microsoft Download center at the <A HREF="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=4172" target=_blank>Microsoft SQL Server Downloads Web site</A>.</P>

<H2><A NAME="_5467_error_reporting_705"></A>5.10 Error Reporting</H2>

<P><I>Introduced in SP3</I></P>

<P>Microsoft SQL Server error reporting is disabled by default. You can enable it during installation through SQL Server Setup or Analysis Services Setup, or after installation through the <B>Server Properties</B> dialog box in Enterprise Manager or the <B>Server</B> <B>Properties</B> dialog box in Analysis Manager. Enabling error reporting while you are running SQL Server Setup allows error reporting for the SQL Server database engine and SQL Server Agent. Enabling error reporting while you are running Analysis Services Setup allows error reporting for Analysis Services. If you want to enable error reporting for both SQL Server and Analysis Services, you must enable error reporting for SQL Server while running SQL Server Setup and Analysis Services while running Analysis Services Setup. </P>

<P>If you enable this feature, SQL Server is configured to send a report to Microsoft automatically if a fatal error occurs in the SQL Server database engine, in SQL Server Agent, or in SQL Server Analysis Services. Microsoft uses error reports to improve SQL Server functionality and treats all information as confidential. </P>

<P>Information about errors is sent over a secure (HTTPS) connection to Microsoft, where it is stored with limited access. Alternatively, this information can be sent to your own Corporate Error Reporting server. See this <A HREF="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=9309" target=_blank>Microsoft Web site</A> for more information about setting up a Corporate Error Reporting server.</P>

<P>The error report contains the following information:

<UL type=disc>
	<LI>The condition of SQL Server when the problem occurred.<BR><BR></LI>

	<LI>The operating system version and computer hardware information.<BR><BR></LI>

	<LI>Your digital Product ID, which can be used to identify your license.<BR><BR></LI>

	<LI>The network IP address of your computer.<BR><BR></LI>

	<LI>Information from memory or files of the process that caused the error.</LI>
</UL>

<P>Microsoft does not intentionally collect your files, name, address, e-mail address, or any other form of personal information. The error report can, however, contain customer-specific information from the memory or files of the process that caused the error. Although this information can potentially be used to determine your identity, Microsoft does not use this information for that purpose.</P>

<P>For the Microsoft error reporting data collection policy, see this <A HREF="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=9310" target=_blank>Microsoft Web site</A>.</P>

<P>If you enable error reporting and a fatal error occurs, you may see a response from Microsoft in the Windows Event log that points to a Microsoft Knowledge Base article about a particular error. A response may look similar to the following example:</P>

<PRE><CODE>Source = MSSQLServerOlapServicesDW 
EventID = 1010
data = http://support.microsoft.com/support/misc/kblookup.asp?id=Q123456
&amp;iBucketTable=1&amp;iBucket=39980&amp;Cab=21474432.cab&amp;LCID=1033
&amp;OS=5.1.2600.2.00010100.0.0</CODE></PRE>

<P>To disable error reporting for the SQL Server database engine and SQL Server Agent, go to SQL Server Properties (General Tab) in Enterprise Manager and clear the <B>Enable the error reporting</B> check box. To disable error reporting for Analysis Services, go to Server Properties in Analysis Manager and clear the <B>Enable Error Reporting</B> check box. If error reporting is enabled for both SQL Server (database engine and SQL Server Agent) and Analysis Services, you must disable error reporting for SQL Server and Analysis Services individually. </P>

<H2><A NAME="_english_query_enhancement"></A>5.11 English Query Enhancements</H2>

<P><I>Introduced in SP1</I></P>

<P>Microsoft has released a security enhancement for English Query applications. This enhancement is not installed as a part of the service pack. However, it is recommended that you apply it if you use English Query. The security enhancement is located on the SP3a CD-ROM in the folder \EQHotfix. Details about the English Query enhancement are available at the <A HREF="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=3930" target=_blank>Microsoft Product Support Services Knowledge Base</A>. Search the Knowledge Base for article <A HREF="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=9134" target=_blank>297105</A>.</P>

<H2><A NAME="_db-library_and_embedded_sql_for_c"></A>5.12 DB-Library and Embedded SQL for C</H2>

<P><I>Introduced in SP1</I></P>

<P>While the DB-Library and Embedded SQL for C APIs are still supported in SQL Server 2000, no future versions of SQL Server will include the files that are necessary to program applications that use these APIs. Connections from existing applications written using DB-Library and Embedded SQL for C will still be supported in the next version of SQL Server, but this support will be dropped in a future release. When writing new applications, avoid using these components. When modifying existing applications, you are strongly encouraged to remove dependencies on these technologies. Instead of DB-Library or Embedded SQL for C, you can use ADO, OLE DB, or ODBC to access data in SQL Server. For more information about these technologies, see SQL Server Books Online.</P>
